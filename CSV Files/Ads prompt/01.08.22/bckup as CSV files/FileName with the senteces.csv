0,0,1001_aID1AD.txt,"""should it not be allowed to produce television advertising directed toward young children at the age between two and five?""."
1,1,1001_aID1AD.txt,"on this question is based the following text, which shows advantages and disadvantages  including my personal opinion."
2,2,1001_aID1AD.txt,"first, the main time a person is watching tv is during the evening."
3,3,1001_aID1AD.txt,some people also watch a movie after lunch while they want to have a short sleep.
4,4,1001_aID1AD.txt,"at this times a child aged two to five even sleeps too or it is playing with friends, so that the child can not see advertsisings."
5,5,1001_aID1AD.txt,"however the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep."
6,6,1001_aID1AD.txt,but during such a movie there is not more than one time advertising.
7,7,1001_aID1AD.txt,"the most children are not interested in this advertsing and do not watch them, so that it is unnessecary to produce television advertising directed to young children, then they do not see them."
8,8,1001_aID1AD.txt,"the most important argument is, that children aged two to five will never understand television advertising even if you show toys or pets, because they do not know the reason of advertising."
9,9,1001_aID1AD.txt,"at my own opinion i will say, that television advertising for young children can be allowed, but it is not nessecary, because they do not watch much films ."
10,10,1001_aID1AD.txt,besides they do not care about the advertising and would not understand the background reasons for it.
11,11,1002_aID1AD.txt,"in the following text, i`ll discuss the statement about the programm of television, which is directed to very young children by the age of two to five."
12,12,1002_aID1AD.txt,"for me itâ´s an important theme to talk about, because the medias in our time can be very dangerous for the developement of children and also teenagers, but in this moment the age of the young chldren is important for the statement."
13,13,1002_aID1AD.txt,"i think, television is something, which is fun and free time for you, but it also can change your opinion about some topics and meanings, which you have."
14,14,1002_aID1AD.txt,"young children are very influenced by everything,which they see and hear, so the television can be dangerous or bad for them, but it can be allowed to cut them from the medias, but itâ´s not the right way, i think."
15,15,1002_aID1AD.txt,"itâ´s better to show them, how to handle with television or games or something like that, because the children are learning for their lifes and not just for the moment."
16,16,1002_aID1AD.txt,"in the statement, itâ´s described that very young children, from the age from two to five, should not watch television and for me it has something true, because in the age of two or three years, you should not watching televeison."
17,17,1002_aID1AD.txt,"a little kid should play with its toys and parents and not watch televison the whole day, because it can be a negative point in its developement."
18,18,1002_aID1AD.txt,"but i think, you canâ´t say no with a law, so itâ´s difficult to handle with this topic."
19,19,1002_aID1AD.txt,"a solution can be, that the parents of the children have to handle right with this topic, because itâ´s important for their children and their developement."
20,20,1002_aID1AD.txt,"older children, like with the age of five or six or elder, it is of course right and possible to watch television with a time, which is given by the parents, so that the cildren can watch a serie for one hour and then itâ´s finished for this day."
21,21,1002_aID1AD.txt,"so all in all, i agree at some parts with the statement, but not at all."
22,22,1002_aID1AD.txt,"the main thing, that is important is the bad influence by television for too young children, so it could exists problems in future, which are developed by the television."
23,23,1003_aID1AD.txt," for the question, if the advertising directed toward young children shoul not be allowed, you can think on some opinions for and against it."
24,24,1003_aID1AD.txt,the television advertising is sometimes very funny and beautiful for the kids.
25,25,1003_aID1AD.txt,so they can lough and be happy.
26,26,1003_aID1AD.txt,"they show some carracters that show the kids how they can do something, and the children are learning something."
27,27,1003_aID1AD.txt,but also there are some advertising that arenâ´t very helpful to show children how they can do something or they can behave.
28,28,1003_aID1AD.txt,"sometimes the children learn something, they shouldnâ´t learn."
29,29,1003_aID1AD.txt,"a situation for example for this is when a child is sad because another child took his car for playing away, so the kid is really sad and donâ´t know what he could do."
30,30,1003_aID1AD.txt,"he saw an advertising where this happend and the solution was that the child hurt the other one, and that is not ok."
31,31,1003_aID1AD.txt,"in reallife the kid who is sad, because he want his car back, knows that he can hurt the other one to get his car."
32,32,1003_aID1AD.txt,so itâ´s not ok to show them this kind of stories because they learn from it...
33,33,1003_aID1AD.txt,they should show how to play a game or to take part in other plays where he can play with other children.
34,34,1003_aID1AD.txt,also i think that children who are at the age of two to five shouldnâ´t be allowed to watch tv because itâ´s not good for their eyes.
35,35,1003_aID1AD.txt,itâ´s better for them to play in the kindergarten or to play with their mum.
36,36,1003_aID1AD.txt,"there are some little things that could make them happy... for axample spending time with their mum, so they can build a better feeling for each other, because they get to know each other better."
37,37,1003_aID1AD.txt,"how i said in the begining there are some funny and beautiful advertising which make the children smile and be happy, but i think that they can do other things for being happy."
38,38,1003_aID1AD.txt,"so all in one i think that the television advertising should be allowed, but those who make the children learn something they shouldnâ´t learn shouldnâ´t be allowed."
39,39,1003_aID1AD.txt,so the advertising should be controlled by some people that know what is right for children aged two to five.
40,40,1004_aID1AD.txt,the following text is about the named statement.
41,41,1004_aID1AD.txt,television is today more impportant than in the past.
42,42,1004_aID1AD.txt,in the past the children go outside an play with other children.
43,43,1004_aID1AD.txt,so its different than today.
44,44,1004_aID1AD.txt,most of children watch television so they are at their own.
45,45,1004_aID1AD.txt,i disagree with this statement because young children aged of two to five should be learn to play with other children at their age.
46,46,1004_aID1AD.txt,when they look tv the children are independent of this media so they can't live without watching tv.
47,47,1004_aID1AD.txt,so the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.
48,48,1004_aID1AD.txt,the reason is that they are in contact with others and that's better for their future.
49,49,1004_aID1AD.txt,it ist so important because later they can meet new friends easier than without playing with others.
50,50,1004_aID1AD.txt,the children without playimg with other children don't know the contact with others.
51,51,1004_aID1AD.txt,so the relationship to other children is better when the children play with other children.
52,52,1004_aID1AD.txt,an arguement could be that the television shows pograms which aren't good for young children.
53,53,1004_aID1AD.txt,also the pograms are for older children (aged seven).
54,54,1004_aID1AD.txt,many pograms aren't real but the children watch them and think they want do the same.
55,55,1004_aID1AD.txt,so the television isn't real.
56,56,1004_aID1AD.txt,many pograms could be dangerous for young children so they dreams bad and that's not good for their little life.
57,57,1004_aID1AD.txt,much peeple say that television is good for their future and it's is the real life b ut it isn't it.
58,58,1004_aID1AD.txt,the shows are played of actors who leatn their text and then play it for the camera and the pproducer.
59,59,1004_aID1AD.txt,so it isn't the real life.
60,60,1004_aID1AD.txt,"""the children can learn of watching tv"" that isn't right because the children learn more in playing with toys."
61,61,1004_aID1AD.txt,beside they learn the rules of their parents and they know in which their are allowed to something and what it isn't allowed to do.
62,62,1004_aID1AD.txt,so the children should'nt watch television because they are things which are better than that.
63,63,1004_aID1AD.txt,also the independence of watching television is tall so later when they are older they want watching tv all the time.
64,64,1004_aID1AD.txt,then they don't meet friends or do a hobby.
65,65,1004_aID1AD.txt,the age of two to five is the most important time of the life of a children because they learn so much about the life and deleope in a fast time.
66,66,1004_aID1AD.txt,the developement of a child in this age is
67,67,1005_aID1AD.txt,"there are arguments for and against the prohibition of television advertising directed toward younger children, which i will summarize and analyze in the following text ."
68,68,1005_aID1AD.txt,"first of all it is well-known that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings, so that they can get manipulated easily as well."
69,69,1005_aID1AD.txt,"this can be used effectively by television advertisements, which portray them a false picture of reality, causing children to ask their parents for things they don't actually need."
70,70,1005_aID1AD.txt,"this is often the case with toys, that are shown to be really fun in advertisements, while in reality they often are quite lame."
71,71,1005_aID1AD.txt,"additionally children can't even realize, when they are getting baited by a company, so that it is up to the parents to explain why a particular product is not as good as portraied in the tv, which most of the time can't be understood by children, which might lead to some sort of unhappiness."
72,72,1005_aID1AD.txt,"nevertheless one can argue if this is reason enough to prohibit advertisements directed toward young children, since it would be pretty hard to establish."
73,73,1005_aID1AD.txt,"nowadays it is common, that even little children spend some time in front of the tv and since there has to be some sort of advertising between two shows that are made for children, it wouldn't be too clever to put something in there, that isn't directed toward children as well."
74,74,1005_aID1AD.txt,"furthermore there are some advertisements that might have a positive consequence on children, for example if an ad promotes physical activity, like going outside and playing with friends, although this is quite rarely the case."
75,75,1005_aID1AD.txt,eventually i think that it really depends on what sort of advertisement it is and what product is getting advertised.
76,76,1005_aID1AD.txt,"as for the previous example with toys: if a false picture of the toy is portraied, to bait consumers into buying, that is obviously not the right way to do it."
77,77,1005_aID1AD.txt,"however an absolute prohibition is, in my opinion, nearly impossible to to happen, because tv companies have to earn their money and companies that produce shows for children are no exception."
78,78,1005_aID1AD.txt,"but as just mentioned, it's the quality of the advertisement that really matters, thus instead of wanting to prohibit them all, one should rather ask for more appropriate ads, that don't damage young children in any way."
79,79,1006_aID1AD.txt,the following essay deals with the question wether telivision advertising directed toward young children aged two to five should be allowed.
80,80,1006_aID1AD.txt,for children the ages two to five are the most important year of development.
81,81,1006_aID1AD.txt,they learn speaking and walking and a lot of other important things.
82,82,1006_aID1AD.txt,the young children should play outside or do other stuff than sitting in fornt of a television and watch some strange series.
83,83,1006_aID1AD.txt,later in life they'll watch a lot of tv and in childhood they shouldn't spend their time with this.
84,84,1006_aID1AD.txt,"if they watch series for example the ""krã¼melmoster"" they may have the same ideas as the actors and do things they aren't allowed or get hurt while doing this."
85,85,1006_aID1AD.txt,the development in this young age is very importent.
86,86,1006_aID1AD.txt,"one can't really tell them what to do ore not, they will experience this themselves."
87,87,1006_aID1AD.txt,but without watching tv they will meet some friends and are outside in the natur.
88,88,1006_aID1AD.txt,they create other ideas without the influence of television.
89,89,1006_aID1AD.txt,they get social contacts which they can't make if they only spend their time infront of the tv.
90,90,1006_aID1AD.txt,for example i got to know my best friend with the age of 1 because our mothers are friends and we only spend out time outside and played with the dogs or by bad weather we built thing and played memories.
91,91,1006_aID1AD.txt,we weren't allowed to watch television and later the only thing we watched was the sandman.
92,92,1006_aID1AD.txt,this only goes ten minutes and was nearly before our bedtime.
93,93,1006_aID1AD.txt,"the age of two to five is the time for children in the kindergarden and there they learn how to behave with other kids, so it's important not to destroy this at home."
94,94,1006_aID1AD.txt,in my oppinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed.
95,95,1007_aID1AD.txt,television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
96,96,1007_aID1AD.txt,with this statement the following text is occupied.
97,97,1007_aID1AD.txt,iâ´m going to compare advantages and disadvantages.
98,98,1007_aID1AD.txt,"an arguement, why children should not be allowed to use television with the age of two to five is, that they are to young to understand a lot of things, which are told there."
99,99,1007_aID1AD.txt,"parents should make sure that their children grows up with things, which are important fot theier future."
100,100,1007_aID1AD.txt,"for example, children with the age of two to five should reed some books or play games like football."
101,101,1007_aID1AD.txt,"also they could draw some pictures or learn, how to spell theier names."
102,102,1007_aID1AD.txt,"if children with young age only watch tv, they will do this also with older age."
103,103,1007_aID1AD.txt,"an advantage is, that a children with young age often has to be alone, because the parents have to work the whole day or must have to do something, where a little children is not usefull."
104,104,1007_aID1AD.txt,"than they could watch tv, with the result that their fixed on the television."
105,105,1007_aID1AD.txt,"also if a children watch important politically soaps earlier, it grows up with a better knowledge of the important things of life."
106,106,1007_aID1AD.txt,but it does not make sense that a young aged children is able to get important information.
107,107,1007_aID1AD.txt,"a young children with the age of two to five has to learn the calours or how to differences animals with other animals, for example."
108,108,1007_aID1AD.txt,"it is better to show them books with a lot of picures than to let them whatch tv .young children should also play outside with friends, because they have to learn the difference of the real world and the world that is showed by the medias."
109,109,1007_aID1AD.txt,"as a result i agree with the statement, because there are a lot of disadvantages and only a few advantages."
110,110,1007_aID1AD.txt,"i think there are a lot of more things, children with young age could do much better than watch television."
111,111,1007_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion, children, who look at pictures or learn the colours with young age have a lot of knwoledge more than children watching tv."
112,112,1008_aID1AD.txt,television advertising is often directed to certain groups of people.
113,113,1008_aID1AD.txt,one of them are children who are between two and five years old.
114,114,1008_aID1AD.txt,there are some people who say that this kind of advertising should not be allowed.
115,115,1008_aID1AD.txt,in the following i will present my opinion on this topic.
116,116,1008_aID1AD.txt,in my opionion there are two sides to this statement.
117,117,1008_aID1AD.txt,i can agree with the people who are saying that this kind of advertising should be forbidden.
118,118,1008_aID1AD.txt,children who are that young don't know how to compromise it.
119,119,1008_aID1AD.txt,"the ads are making everything more colorful and brighter, and they do not necessarily show reality."
120,120,1008_aID1AD.txt,the children really want to have the product and might annoy their parents until they buy it.
121,121,1008_aID1AD.txt,it's also not fair of the marketing people.
122,122,1008_aID1AD.txt,"they use young children, who might never had contact to any kind of media before, just to make money."
123,123,1008_aID1AD.txt,"they know exactly what the children want and they use this knowledge, just to make themselves richer."
124,124,1008_aID1AD.txt,"but on the other hand, there are some reasons why i disagree with this statement."
125,125,1008_aID1AD.txt,"even if the child really wants the product that was advertised on tv, the decisions if it's bought or not will be made by the parents."
126,126,1008_aID1AD.txt,the child can't just buy things on its own.
127,127,1008_aID1AD.txt,"the role of the parents is another reason, why i think commercials should be allowed: the parents can decide when and how often children watch tv."
128,128,1008_aID1AD.txt,and it is their decision if they want a two- year old boy or girl to watch tv.
129,129,1008_aID1AD.txt,the other reason why it should be allowed is one simple thing: you can't hide advertising.
130,130,1008_aID1AD.txt,"sooner or later the kids will be confronted with ads, and it could be good to let them know early enough that it is out there."
131,131,1008_aID1AD.txt,when they become older they will know better how to handle advertisment.
132,132,1008_aID1AD.txt,"children will know, that they can't have everything they want and that not everything is like it is in tv."
133,133,1008_aID1AD.txt,"the things shown in the commercials aren't reality, but it is the reality that commercials are out there in real life."
134,134,1008_aID1AD.txt,"and if tv advertisment towards children isn't allowed, commercials in magazines, on the radio and especially on the internet shouldn't be allowed as well."
135,135,1008_aID1AD.txt,"children get a phone earlier every generation, and with that they have the connection to everything that is out there."
136,136,1008_aID1AD.txt,and the internet is even harder to control than tv.
137,137,1008_aID1AD.txt,one decision must lead to other decisions as well.
138,138,1008_aID1AD.txt,"all-in-all i say, that i disagree with the ststement ""television advertising directed toward younger children should not be allowed""."
139,139,1008_aID1AD.txt,the parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought in the end.
140,140,1008_aID1AD.txt,"and children will  be confronted with commercials anyway, it is not just on tv."
141,141,1009_aID1AD.txt,should advertising toward young children be allowed?
142,142,1009_aID1AD.txt,in this essay i will show off the advantages and disadvantages of this topic and comment on it.
143,143,1009_aID1AD.txt,of course it is interesting for a little girl to watch tv and see a doll in the advertising that wants to play with her.
144,144,1009_aID1AD.txt,"but what if the mother of the girl is so poor, she works everyday to be able to buy food and has no money for that doll?"
145,145,1009_aID1AD.txt,the girls wants the doll so bad that the mother doesn't know how to react.
146,146,1009_aID1AD.txt,"the doll can even talk and dance, but that is why she is so expensive."
147,147,1009_aID1AD.txt,now imagine the girl never saw this advertising.
148,148,1009_aID1AD.txt,she wouldn't talk about this doll and her mother wouldn't be in despair.
149,149,1009_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion advertising toward young children shouln't be allowed.
150,150,1009_aID1AD.txt,children don't earn money and can't buy things on their own.
151,151,1009_aID1AD.txt,many children spend too much time on watching tv.
152,152,1009_aID1AD.txt,people go working and people have families.
153,153,1009_aID1AD.txt,sometimes it is hard to connect working and having a family.
154,154,1009_aID1AD.txt,"exspecially if a mother thinks, that she can't make her daughter happy because of not buying a doll she saw while watching television advertising."
155,155,1010_aID1AD.txt,the following text discusses the statement if television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should be allowed or not.
156,156,1010_aID1AD.txt,"imagine, young children sitting infront of the television."
157,157,1010_aID1AD.txt,if those young children see advertising for the necessary or the right stuff it might be usefull that they watch this advertising.
158,158,1010_aID1AD.txt,although they are directed toward the children the ads can be usefull for the parents.
159,159,1010_aID1AD.txt,but on the other hand they are just kids and so they would be totally influenced by this.
160,160,1010_aID1AD.txt,even adults are influenced by advertising because it sticks to your mind and you can't influence which advertising you watch.
161,161,1010_aID1AD.txt,so young children who aren't grown up at all would be victims of those advertisings.
162,162,1010_aID1AD.txt,furthermore if the parents don't control their kids they watch many of those ads so that in the end the children have a complete wrong view of the reality because they think thst those ads show the reality.
163,163,1010_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion, i would forbit those ads because i think that children should grow up without all the influence and should do other stuff then watching the tv."
164,164,1010_aID1AD.txt,"so, i as a mother, would not want that my kid watches all the ads which show my kid a different way of the reality."
165,165,1011_aID1AD.txt,did young children bacame addicted to modern technic?
166,166,1011_aID1AD.txt,in the following text i am going to discuss the question and will give my own opinion about the statement wether television should be allowed to young children or not.
167,167,1011_aID1AD.txt,i recognised that many children grow up  different since i bacame older.
168,168,1011_aID1AD.txt,"some of them does not know the old classics like playing outside ""i build my one garden"" or games which have to do with fantasy and your own imagination."
169,169,1011_aID1AD.txt,they replace their imagionation with a cartoon instead of thinking on their own.
170,170,1011_aID1AD.txt,i think it is important that you as a parent support the devolpment of your child.
171,171,1011_aID1AD.txt,many young children are not really recognised by their parents.
172,172,1011_aID1AD.txt,instead of spending their time with them they make their life easier and put them infront of a television.
173,173,1011_aID1AD.txt,"i know that it is not easy to raise up a child, but you decided wether you can handle the stress and work or not."
174,174,1011_aID1AD.txt,you know that a child will bring up problems and(verantwortung) ......
175,175,1011_aID1AD.txt,"it is not bad for the child if it watchs tv a few times a week, but it has to be controlled the time and easpacially what kind of tv they are watching."
176,176,1011_aID1AD.txt,"otherwise i think it is not possible to forbid television for children under five years, because each parents have their own way to let their kid grow."
177,177,1011_aID1AD.txt,it does not mean that television makes you child uncreative or stupid but showing your child how to handle all these unreal and given impressions is important for his/ her following development.
178,178,1011_aID1AD.txt,"finally i can say that i do not agree with the given statement, bacause if you forbit something it bacomes more interesting."
179,179,1011_aID1AD.txt,you have to know how to handle the modern development of technic in our world and not to allow something is not the right way.
180,180,1011_aID1AD.txt,prepare your children right for the modern world.
181,181,1012_aID1AD.txt,"in the following text i will discuss if ""television advertising directed toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed""
general television advertising influence of course all of the people,also young people,because the advertise is always shown in a perfect way without faults, because they want that everybody will buy the product,so therefore they will earn a lot of money.when young people see something very special for them on the television, they tell their parents that they want it, but they only want it, because it was shown so perfect and not because they tried it."
182,182,1012_aID1AD.txt,at the most time the products are very expensive and the parents do not want it to buy for the children.
183,183,1012_aID1AD.txt,but i also think that children with two years do not recognize the advertise so well than children with five years.
184,184,1012_aID1AD.txt,"the two years old children will not react like five years old children, maybe they will strike or something like that,if they do not get that product."
185,185,1012_aID1AD.txt,but the two years old children will forget it and maybe their parents will buy another toy/product which is better and cheaper and the child will also be happy about it.
186,186,1012_aID1AD.txt,"i think that the statement ""television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"" is right in a way, but i think that children until three years do not have the knowledge about that stuff, so thatâ´s why i think young children until three can see television advertising, but for older young children until six or seven, when they come to school,it schould not be allowed, because they have the knowledge and can discuss withe their parents about it."
187,187,1013_aID1AD.txt,"many people don`t like advertisements for young children, especially for children from two to five."
188,188,1013_aID1AD.txt,"first, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch tv."
189,189,1013_aID1AD.txt,"and if they are allowed to - for  example half an hour, the parents (and the children too) doesn`t want to have different advertisements in tv."
190,190,1013_aID1AD.txt,"the parents because they think it`s not good for the child, it may want something, it doesn`t need, and the child just wants to watch its series on tv."
191,191,1013_aID1AD.txt,advertisements would only steal them their expensive and very short time.
192,192,1013_aID1AD.txt,"theres another argument against advertisements towards young children: imagine, you`re a children at age two to five."
193,193,1013_aID1AD.txt,would you be interestet in buying stuff to play with?
194,194,1013_aID1AD.txt,"yes, of course you would be."
195,195,1013_aID1AD.txt,"so you ask your parents to buy these toys for you, and (as actually everytime you ask) they say no."
196,196,1013_aID1AD.txt,"this is sad and depressing, isn`t ist?"
197,197,1013_aID1AD.txt,"so some companies may save the children from being sad and do the advertisements towards the parents, maybe with some deeper information for them."
198,198,1013_aID1AD.txt,but there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.
199,199,1013_aID1AD.txt,"for so many children its too difficult to learn, that parents often don`t allow them to be outside until 9pm or like in this discussion, buying some playing stuff (from the advertisements) for them."
200,200,1013_aID1AD.txt,"they must accept, that they cannot have everything."
201,201,1013_aID1AD.txt,"and if they weren`t confronted by advertisements and the `no` of their parents, they never learn it."
202,202,1013_aID1AD.txt,another important thing is the knowledge of the children.
203,203,1013_aID1AD.txt,"they actually never get to know different toys, like 'barbie', 'lego' or even 'playmobil'."
204,204,1013_aID1AD.txt,"probably the parents don`t go to a toy shop with their kids very often, so an advertisement is a good way to get to know some playing stuff."
205,205,1013_aID1AD.txt,and some of these different toys will show them tecnical and motorical skills.
206,206,1013_aID1AD.txt,"so all in all i would say, advertisements for young children are a good thing to get them learn to hear a 'no' and to let their skills grow."
207,207,1013_aID1AD.txt,the only important point is the behaviour of the parents toward the children.
208,208,1013_aID1AD.txt,"they are supposed to look for their children, to not let them too often watch tv and espacially not too long - it would be bad for the child."
209,209,1013_aID1AD.txt,buying some (of course not everything they want) toys for the children and let them play with them or reading a book with them are much better opportunities.
210,210,1014_aID1AD.txt,should television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) be forbidden?
211,211,1014_aID1AD.txt,in  the following text i am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.
212,212,1014_aID1AD.txt,in the television there are several different ways of advertising for a product or an campaign.
213,213,1014_aID1AD.txt,for example songs that you will remember even four weeks later or situations out of daily life.
214,214,1014_aID1AD.txt,besides you can watch advertisements in tv that show people who do embarassing things so that the spectators laugh about them.
215,215,1014_aID1AD.txt,that`s why there is the problem of advertisements directed toward little children in the age from two to five.
216,216,1014_aID1AD.txt,as they are able to sing the song that they listened to in television or want exactly these cookies that their star is eating in the advertisement too.
217,217,1014_aID1AD.txt,that these little persons are influenced by such advertisement is a sad fact.
218,218,1014_aID1AD.txt,one can pretend them from that by forbid them to watch tv.
219,219,1014_aID1AD.txt,"apart from television there are so much interesting things to do and let them know how things are working: for example showing them how to bake a cake, drawing pictures or doing other creative work."
220,220,1014_aID1AD.txt,but there are also reasons that are for the idea of allowing advertisements toward little children in tv.
221,221,1014_aID1AD.txt,the earlier they are confronted to advertisements the better they can resist them when they are older.
222,222,1014_aID1AD.txt,that would cause not buying the things that one has seen in tv but instead of that being independent from the advertisements.
223,223,1014_aID1AD.txt,all in all i would say that i donâ´t agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because i think that there is nothing to worry about if  little children come in contact with television advertisements.
224,224,1014_aID1AD.txt,so nobody cares when you watch them first.
225,225,1014_aID1AD.txt,it is clear that you are going to watch them ones and it could be a way to make people resistant to advertisements.
226,226,1015_aID1AD.txt,in the following text i am going to evaluate if i agree or disagree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
227,227,1015_aID1AD.txt,"usually i would say that it does not matter to me what kind of advertisement they are showing during different shows or films, but this statement made me think about it."
228,228,1015_aID1AD.txt,and so now this is waht i came up with.
229,229,1015_aID1AD.txt,advertisement is something that we all hate i guess i can say that.
230,230,1015_aID1AD.txt,but sometimes especially the ones for little kids are just funny and entertaining to watch.
231,231,1015_aID1AD.txt,furthermore it is brilliant to see how happy kids can get just by watching the little clip of maybe just 10 seconds.
232,232,1015_aID1AD.txt,"also, isn't it just really nice to see all the new things they are inventing for them?"
233,233,1015_aID1AD.txt,and sometimes you even feel like you want to be a little kid again just to be able to try all these brand-new amazing things.
234,234,1015_aID1AD.txt,but there is also the other side of the problem.
235,235,1015_aID1AD.txt,first of all i think that children in that age should not be watching as much television at all.
236,236,1015_aID1AD.txt,i feel like if they are watching all these advertisements between their movie they are going to want these things really bad most of the times.
237,237,1015_aID1AD.txt,we all know that situation don't we?
238,238,1015_aID1AD.txt,"there is a new advertisement on the tv showing something really nice, you are going to get the feeling of really wanting to be owner of this."
239,239,1015_aID1AD.txt,"so it can start to be really annoying, especially for parents, if kids will never stop talking about wanting what they just saw on the tv."
240,240,1015_aID1AD.txt,"the parents, or somebody else, eventually has to buy it and after a while it gets boring or they are going to start wanting something new."
241,241,1015_aID1AD.txt,so people just keep spending money and more money on things their kids see in an advertisement.
242,242,1015_aID1AD.txt,moreover industries invent toys or other things that are dangerous for kids.
243,243,1015_aID1AD.txt,"if they are going to see that on the tv, they are going to really want to play with something like that."
244,244,1015_aID1AD.txt,in addition to that i can say that advertisements are rarely showing the truth.
245,245,1015_aID1AD.txt,"sometimes the toy or whatever isn't as fancy as it seems or people in the advertisement do not show the right behavior that the parents taught them before, so kids are going to question everything and we all know how annoying this could end."
246,246,1015_aID1AD.txt,"also, did you realize that we barely even have conversations in this time anymore?"
247,247,1015_aID1AD.txt,we barely talk to each other and that is also because of people spending too much time with social media and other electronical devices.
248,248,1015_aID1AD.txt,i think the little kids from today should go outside and ask their friend about their new toy better than watching tv and seeing all the new things there.
249,249,1015_aID1AD.txt,i also remember me having fun to go outside and not having to worry about an television advertisement.
250,250,1015_aID1AD.txt,but i sure have to say that i remember me really wanting something from an advertisement as well.
251,251,1015_aID1AD.txt,as you can see this is a topic people could probably discuss about all day.
252,252,1015_aID1AD.txt,but in my opinion i have to say that i do agree with the statement above.
253,253,1015_aID1AD.txt,"i think television advertisement toward young children should not be allowed, because there is so many more exciting things in this world they should see, and they shouldn't get jealous of other kids, because they have something new from the advertisement that they do not have."
254,254,1015_aID1AD.txt,"and also, their parents would probably also have a much easier life."
255,255,1016_aID1AD.txt,"in the following text i am going to mention some arguments for and against the statement: ""telivision advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed""."
256,256,1016_aID1AD.txt,"may one can say that advertising directed toward young children should be allowed, because it is allowed to be directed toward everyone in every age."
257,257,1016_aID1AD.txt,"of course it is a weak argument, but at least it is one."
258,258,1016_aID1AD.txt,also one has to add that young children aged two to five normally do not watch tv that often.
259,259,1016_aID1AD.txt,therefore it does not really matter if there is that kind of advertising or not.
260,260,1016_aID1AD.txt,but in case that the children watch tv nearly all day it could be helpful for later.
261,261,1016_aID1AD.txt,maybe the children are not interested in this advertising in a way and do not listen to it or watch it.
262,262,1016_aID1AD.txt,"so there is the chance that they won't be interested in advertisding later as well, so they won't be easily influenced."
263,263,1016_aID1AD.txt,but that is only guessed.
264,264,1016_aID1AD.txt,one aspect that is against television advertising directed toward young people is that it is not good to get influenced in this young age.
265,265,1016_aID1AD.txt,"and if one thinks about it in a rational way, it becomes clear that children are interested in advertising."
266,266,1016_aID1AD.txt,"especially, if the advertising presents new things to play with."
267,267,1016_aID1AD.txt,"also, they do not really have the chance to have or to build an own opinion, because they are too young."
268,268,1016_aID1AD.txt,as a consequence they need to agree with the advertising or at least to believe it is true.
269,269,1016_aID1AD.txt,"for example if it is about a new snack that is ""so good for children, because it suppports them in becoming large and stong"" but actually its main ingredient is sugarl."
270,270,1016_aID1AD.txt,so they believe in wrong things and regard lies as true.
271,271,1016_aID1AD.txt,"this could be a problem for their later life, because they won't be able to see the difference between lies and  the truth."
272,272,1016_aID1AD.txt,"all in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion."
273,273,1016_aID1AD.txt,that is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+
274,274,1017_aID1AD.txt,"in the following i tell you my oppinion of the question, if television advertising directed toward young children between two to five years shuold not be allowed."
275,275,1017_aID1AD.txt,"in my mind it is not a question of the age of the children, because i think that television is not good for anybody, but i think everybody has to chose for his self, because it is his or her life and not the life of the anyone else."
276,276,1017_aID1AD.txt,"so i think, that the parents have to chose if there children are allowed to have a television."
277,277,1017_aID1AD.txt,"the children hast  to learn about the politics and know what is beeing in the world, but kids under five years would not be interested of the politics and the other things to learn in the television, so the films and series for kids have to be kontrolled by the parents."
278,278,1017_aID1AD.txt,"so they can not whatch films and series, which are not allowed for them."
279,279,1017_aID1AD.txt,"the kids have to whatch films and series to learn also from them , who made for the children, but they dont have to have a television for him or herself."
280,280,1017_aID1AD.txt,"it is a part of the the youth of many kids, they not have to have a television to have a good youth, because if the parents spend time for their children, they can also have fun without an own tv."
281,281,1017_aID1AD.txt,"so if the parents dont want to allow a tv for the childs, they have to soend time for them."
282,282,1017_aID1AD.txt,"but if the parents can say stop if the child whatched to much tv or watch movies and serier, which are not allowed to whatch for a child in  his age, then i think the child should be allowed to have or watch tv."
283,283,1017_aID1AD.txt,"to sum up, i am against this toward, because not every parents have time to spend time for his or her children and the tv is a good alternative to entertain the children."
284,284,1017_aID1AD.txt,so every parents had to chose for his own child and also for themself.
285,285,1018_aID1AD.txt,"chlidren form the age of two to five have not been able to develop their own charcter jet, that makes them an easy target for advertisement, because they are easy to influence."
286,286,1018_aID1AD.txt,"the question now is, should advertisement directed to children, of the named age, not be allowed ?"
287,287,1018_aID1AD.txt,"children of the age from two to five are the future of the human society, which means that they are the ones that will determ the things that will be bought, in the future, and the standards that will define our future society."
288,288,1018_aID1AD.txt,"advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing, it can be used to influence them so that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature."
289,289,1018_aID1AD.txt,"the promblem with advertisement, which is directet to children, is that it does not aim for a better futer."
290,290,1018_aID1AD.txt,"the people that make the advertisment aim for money, they mainly see their own profit and not the negative influence they have on children."
291,291,1018_aID1AD.txt,"by trying to sell their products, they can set unrealistic standars of beauty or material things that children may want to own one day."
292,292,1018_aID1AD.txt,"the consequences of this can be depression, because nobody is happy with their body or with the stuff they own and they will simply be unhappy."
293,293,1018_aID1AD.txt,"children should have the chance to develop their own character as isolatet from advertisement as possible, so that they can find out for themselves, what they want to look like and what they want to own and in which way they can find pleasure and happines."
294,294,1018_aID1AD.txt,"bacause of these given arguments i come to the conclusion, that advertisment directet to children should not be allowed because it takes away their chance to develop their own individual charcter."
295,295,1019_aID1AD.txt,"a argument on the statement ""television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed""."
296,296,1019_aID1AD.txt,first i will write the argument against the statement.
297,297,1019_aID1AD.txt,children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need.
298,298,1019_aID1AD.txt,in this age they are  already able to show us what they want.
299,299,1019_aID1AD.txt,"the children probably don't even understand the television advertisment, but the parents like the advertisment more when it is a well made advertisment."
300,300,1019_aID1AD.txt,"young children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch."
301,301,1019_aID1AD.txt,second i will write arguments for the statement.
302,302,1019_aID1AD.txt,the advertisment has an influence on the children and in this age they don't know when they are under an influence.
303,303,1019_aID1AD.txt,additionaly only the parents know what they can afford and the children don't think about the price of something they just want it or not.
304,304,1019_aID1AD.txt,"the children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want, and the children don't understand why their parents don't buy them what they want because they don't understand the use of money."
305,305,1019_aID1AD.txt,"i think that television advertising that is directed towards young children should not be allowed, but young children should not watch much television and the parents should control what their children watch."
306,306,1021_aID1AD.txt,"in the following text i will write a text about the statement ""television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."""
307,307,1021_aID1AD.txt,first we live in the 20 century an it is impossible to use nothing technoligy.
308,308,1021_aID1AD.txt,young children get up with new smartphones or other things.
309,309,1021_aID1AD.txt,the children in the age two to five get up too with the new technoligy.
310,310,1021_aID1AD.txt,second i think young children haven't a own opinion and look at the persons at the television.
311,311,1021_aID1AD.txt,the persons give us a wrong point of view.
312,312,1021_aID1AD.txt,on the on hand parents have more time for oneself or other things.
313,313,1021_aID1AD.txt,and the young children watching tv and have fun.
314,314,1021_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand the young children need fresh air and the conversation with parents or friends, wehn the children watching tv all day, they are allone and haven't activity."
315,315,1021_aID1AD.txt,"the televison has positiv points, because young children learn at the television colours or other things."
316,316,1021_aID1AD.txt,but a negativ point is that she learn things that she don't need for example bad words.
317,317,1021_aID1AD.txt,"i think that it is important for young children watching television but it is important what they watch and how long, because they need conversation with other persons and activitys."
318,318,1022_aID1AD.txt,"there are different oppinions to the statement ""television advertising directed toward young children (aged two or five)should not be allowed."""
319,319,1022_aID1AD.txt,in this essay i am going to give some arguments pro and contra this topic.
320,320,1022_aID1AD.txt,"as children have tv channels that are directly presenting shows for their age, it is logical that they have to get money."
321,321,1022_aID1AD.txt,tv channels like nickelodeon or kika are very common and the children like them very much so it would be sad for them to turn them off because the channels are not allowed to show advertising.
322,322,1022_aID1AD.txt,so it is important to show advertising to young children so the channels can stay alive.
323,323,1022_aID1AD.txt,another argument is the industry that produces toys and other things for young children.
324,324,1022_aID1AD.txt,they really need to present their advertisements to children and not only to grown-ups because otherwise they would not sell nearly as much as they do now.
325,325,1022_aID1AD.txt,children see the toys on the tv and ask their parents if they can have it.
326,326,1022_aID1AD.txt,"when only parents would get advertisements for toys, most of them would not really care about it and they probably would not buy the toy the kid would have chose - especially the more expensive ones."
327,327,1022_aID1AD.txt,so the toy-industry needs the advertising toward young children to sell their products and get money.
328,328,1022_aID1AD.txt,another argument for the advertising is that children always want to be treated as grown-ups so they like to watch advertising on television because it is a thing that is also on channels for older people and so they maybe feel more accepted as a child in the world of adults.
329,329,1022_aID1AD.txt,but there are also some convincing arguments against showing young children advertisings on tv.
330,330,1022_aID1AD.txt,the most important one is that the kids can be manipulated into buying things they see.
331,331,1022_aID1AD.txt,"if a advertisement is really good and adresses the child with - for example - bright coulours and a catching name, the child is most likely going to want the toy or other thing it sees."
332,332,1022_aID1AD.txt,"they will then ask their parent to buy it, but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys even if they want to."
333,333,1022_aID1AD.txt,some parents will maybe buy the toys and then do not have enough money left for other things.
334,334,1022_aID1AD.txt,if they would not buy the toy the child would be very sad or angry about his parents and probably also be bullied by other kids because they do not have the newest ball or other kind of things.
335,335,1022_aID1AD.txt,"besides that these toys can be really expensive, they also tend to be useless."
336,336,1022_aID1AD.txt,"especially kids at a very yound age really want to have a toy, then play with it for a while before loosing interest."
337,337,1022_aID1AD.txt,it will then lay in a cupboard and be forgotten.
338,338,1022_aID1AD.txt,after a while the child will fill its room with things it does not play with anymore and does not need it.
339,339,1022_aID1AD.txt,that might be not as bad at the first view but when the child grows older it is going to want a more adult room and then has to throw a lot of toys away or has to donate or sell it if possible.
340,340,1022_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion it is a very controverse thopic and i cannot say if i am against or for it.
341,341,1022_aID1AD.txt,i would rather make a compromise.
342,342,1022_aID1AD.txt,i think that we should allow companies to show their advertisements to young children and i think that we also should let the children watch it.
343,343,1022_aID1AD.txt,but in my opinion they should keep the amount of advertisements they show between kids tv channels to a minimum and they should also just play the advertisement at the end of a show so the kid does not get interrupted by it and as a result watches all the advertisements while waiting the show to go on.
344,344,1022_aID1AD.txt,finally also the parents should keep an eye on their very young children so they do not spend all their time watching tv because tv itself is not very good for them either.
345,345,1023_aID1AD.txt,the statement is about ''television advertising toward young children'' and is a very complex topic with a lot of pros and cons.
346,346,1023_aID1AD.txt,"i will start off with the pros, come to the cons after that and give my opion at the end."
347,347,1023_aID1AD.txt,"at first children, especially at a very young age, are very easy to influence."
348,348,1023_aID1AD.txt,that is why parents always should pay attention about what they are watching.
349,349,1023_aID1AD.txt,they could get bad dreams about scary things they watch or develop a fear all of the sudden.
350,350,1023_aID1AD.txt,"as they can be influenced so easily, they also might want to have every new toy they see on tv and rather look at these new things on the tv, than go out and play with the toys they already own."
351,351,1023_aID1AD.txt,"now i will talk abbout the pros of this statement: when the children see for example the toys, that they want to have, on tv, it is easier to buy them because their parents do not have to take them to the store."
352,352,1023_aID1AD.txt,"if the child would come with them, they would probably find other toys and would want to buy them all."
353,353,1023_aID1AD.txt,"another reasons is that they would not even unterstand everything, so it is not important if they watch it or do not."
354,354,1023_aID1AD.txt,"in my opion it is very important that children are protected from adversiting, because they are so easy to influence and probably believe the things that are said, even though they are not true."
355,355,1023_aID1AD.txt,i think that the channels should not be too influenced by that and that the always have to keep an eye on their children to prevent them from seeing something bad.
356,356,1024_aID1AD.txt,todays selling strategies are especially about making money in any possible way and of course the advertising towards the costumer plays a big role for that.
357,357,1024_aID1AD.txt,but should there be an age limit that forbids it that younger children stand under the influence of the companies?
358,358,1024_aID1AD.txt,"a well known strategy to make profit is adressing the costumer directly and in buisness all tricks are allowed, so why not make the product attracting to little children who are an easy target since they donâ´t think about the fact if they really need it."
359,359,1024_aID1AD.txt,obviously itâ´s just an easy to make the commercial colorful and interesting so that the young kids get the feeling they despretly need that certain toy.
360,360,1024_aID1AD.txt,of course itâ´s the parents that pay but the children are being annoying and loud for so long until they finally get what they want.
361,361,1024_aID1AD.txt,so some people might say those children are too young and shouldnâ´t stand under that influence because they canâ´t decide wether that toy is actually that much fun and laugh as it is presented on tv.
362,362,1024_aID1AD.txt,but that argument is quite small since the children might want something for the outdoor fun like a new special ball and so they want to play outside and stop sitting in front of the tv and that canâ´t be bad at all.
363,363,1024_aID1AD.txt,finally i support the opinion that television advertising towards young children doesnâ´t have to be forbidden because itâ´s not just the influence of tv commercial even when they go to the shops with their parents the companies always try to get the young ones to be interested in their products.
364,364,1024_aID1AD.txt,so it wouldnâ´t make a difference at all for the children themselves just for the tv channels to reorganize the programm.
365,365,1026_aID1AD.txt,"on the one hand, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it's unhealthy for them to whatch television too often since that could cause that they don't move enough."
366,366,1026_aID1AD.txt,it's important that children go outside and move instead of sitting in front of the tv the whole time.
367,367,1026_aID1AD.txt,"moreover, they could get used to technic too much when they already whatch tv in that young age too often."
368,368,1026_aID1AD.txt,"they want to use computers, smartphones and tablets etc."
369,369,1026_aID1AD.txt,in their future way too often because they think it's just normal and everybody does it because television advertising directed toward young children was allowed.
370,370,1026_aID1AD.txt,so they stay in their room all the time and don't go outside because they can have contact with their friends by using their smartphones which is very unhealthy.
371,371,1026_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed because it's very interesting for them because they can learn something."
372,372,1026_aID1AD.txt,"for instance, there are many shows on the tv that are especially for very young children and that try to teach them something by having fun which can be very effective."
373,373,1026_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but the parents shouldn't let their children whatch tv too often because it's very important for their health and social life that they also do other things, for example play with their friends."
374,374,1026_aID1AD.txt,"i think that the parents should make a rule that says how long their children are allowed to whatch tv and what they are allowed to whatch, for instance half an hour a day and just the programm that's especially for childrem so that it can't happen that the parents sit their children in front of the tv so that they don't have to care about them."
375,375,1026_aID1AD.txt,"it's very important that they undertake something with their children, for example they could go to the playgroung."
376,376,1026_aID1AD.txt,"in the end, i'd like to say that young children should be allowed to whatch tv because it can be interesting for them and they can learn something."
377,377,1026_aID1AD.txt,but their parents have to whatch that they don't do it too long.
378,378,1027_aID1AD.txt,"in the following, i will write an essay discussing the prohibition of television advertising toward young children."
379,379,1027_aID1AD.txt,"on the one hand, there seems to be no need for a prohibition of especially this type of advertisements since most of the children aged 2 to 5 are allowed to watch television anyway and are therefore confronted with other advertisements, that might have an even more negative impact on their development, e.g."
380,380,1027_aID1AD.txt,"on top of that, there is the chance that these advertisements create an interest the children can dedicate their life to, e.g."
381,381,1027_aID1AD.txt,playmobil toys of ancient rome may create a passion for this epoque.
382,382,1027_aID1AD.txt,"nevertheless, this includes the risk of bad habits that may have a negative influence on their further life."
383,383,1027_aID1AD.txt,"so, on the other hand, we have to consider this kind of television advertising as dangerous, as parents cannot realize their ideas of education anymore if they allow their children to watch televion."
384,384,1027_aID1AD.txt,"for example, they might consider a close contact to nature as necessary, but due to an advertisement, their child is completely fixed on the advertised toys and does not want to leave the house anymore."
385,385,1027_aID1AD.txt,"all in all, i think that it is necessary to differentiate."
386,386,1027_aID1AD.txt,advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.
387,387,1027_aID1AD.txt,"eventually, it depends on the content of the advertisement and how the parents can include this in thei"
388,388,1028_aID1AD.txt,young children can be easiliy influenced by everything.
389,389,1028_aID1AD.txt,"so if they watch tv, an advertisement could easily make them want to have the product shown in the advert."
390,390,1028_aID1AD.txt,"so there comes up the question, should tv advertising dirceted towards young children be forbidden."
391,391,1028_aID1AD.txt,"there is the question, how far we are gonig to go, to protect our children."
392,392,1028_aID1AD.txt,"and although an advert could heavily influence them they are most likely not going to grow up, if they don't get in contact with adverts."
393,393,1028_aID1AD.txt,"because if they don't get adressed, while they are 2-5, they are going to be when they are 6."
394,394,1028_aID1AD.txt,so how is there any difference.
395,395,1028_aID1AD.txt,"if they dont get the experience of watching adverts, they will not be able to deal with them, even if they are  older."
396,396,1028_aID1AD.txt,furthermore these adverts don't damage the kids at all.
397,397,1028_aID1AD.txt,"they are just showing new toys, of cereals."
398,398,1028_aID1AD.txt,"and even if they are trash, why ahouldn't the companies have the right, to show the world, what they created there."
399,399,1028_aID1AD.txt,"the children have to learn, that not everinthing is like it looks in the advert."
400,400,1028_aID1AD.txt,"and even if it makes them cry, it will form their character."
401,401,1028_aID1AD.txt,"finally, the adverts might want to make a child force their parents to buy a toy for them."
402,402,1028_aID1AD.txt,"and if it cries because they wont, then it will have to learn its' lesson."
403,403,1028_aID1AD.txt,"and if the parents want to give their sweetie anything it desires, and they have to buy every f***ing toy it sees in an advert, then don't blame the advert, but blame the parent."
404,404,1028_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion, there is no real reason to forbid such tv adverts, because the experience of such things are very importat for children of that age."
405,405,1028_aID1AD.txt,"there are no convincing arguments for this ponit and i am sure, that this is never going to happen, because it doesn't make any sense at all."
406,406,1029_aID1AD.txt,"concerning the given statement about television advertising toward young children, people have differnt opinions."
407,407,1029_aID1AD.txt,some are convinced they should not be allowed while others don't mind them.
408,408,1029_aID1AD.txt,"in the following, the statement will be evaluated."
409,409,1029_aID1AD.txt,"on the one hand, children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising, as they watch television."
410,410,1029_aID1AD.txt,ads that are directed toward people their age would be better for their intellects than those that are meant for adults only.
411,411,1029_aID1AD.txt,"to keep them safe from sexual and violent subjects, it would be helpful to show the right ads on channels they watch."
412,412,1029_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand, chidren aged two to five should generally not be allowed to watch television regularly."
413,413,1029_aID1AD.txt,"if parents are responsible with their childrens' time management, there is no need for tv companies to show ads directed toward them."
414,414,1029_aID1AD.txt,it is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them.
415,415,1029_aID1AD.txt,having seen an interesting ad about a toy for example can have them begging for it.
416,416,1029_aID1AD.txt,"but actually, those children are not customers yet."
417,417,1029_aID1AD.txt,they don't have a say in what their parents buy them.
418,418,1029_aID1AD.txt,"therefore, advertising about toys and other childrens' products should also be directed toward parents, since they are potential customers - not the children themselves."
419,419,1029_aID1AD.txt,"in conclusion, even though children are an important part of today's economy, they should not be confronted with advertsing directed toward them in public media."
420,420,1030_aID1AD.txt,advertising follow us through our whole life.
421,421,1030_aID1AD.txt,even young children are used to listen and see advertising.
422,422,1030_aID1AD.txt,should young children be influenced by television advertising?
423,423,1030_aID1AD.txt,in the following i will discuss this statement.
424,424,1030_aID1AD.txt,on the one hand young children have to learn how to deal with advertising.
425,425,1030_aID1AD.txt,for example that not everything what is said in advertsings is right or usefull.
426,426,1030_aID1AD.txt,if they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.
427,427,1030_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand advertising could be an bad influence either.
428,428,1030_aID1AD.txt,if young children are confronted with so much advertising that they didn't even realize that the things in advertising aren't real and in cause of that they will believe in things that aren' real and build their world on wrong thoughts.
429,429,1030_aID1AD.txt,for example that little girls could think that unicorns and elves are real because they saw that in tv.
430,430,1030_aID1AD.txt,it could be hard for the parents to explain their kids that the unicorns are only animated and that they don't live in the real world.
431,431,1030_aID1AD.txt,such a statement could be shocking for a young child.
432,432,1030_aID1AD.txt,"but it is normal for kids to believe in things that aren't real, like princesses or fairytales."
433,433,1030_aID1AD.txt,if they grow up they will realize that they lived in castle of fantasies.
434,434,1030_aID1AD.txt,it is a normal experience for kids and nothing to worry about because it worked for generations of children.
435,435,1030_aID1AD.txt,furthermore the parents could prepare their kids.
436,436,1030_aID1AD.txt,for example it is necesarry to talk about the advertising and the parents should explain their kids that you can't buy everything just because it looks fantastic in the advertisement.
437,437,1030_aID1AD.txt,they could make a trip through the supermarket and show their kids the toys of the television advertising and show them either that they aren't that fantastic.
438,438,1030_aID1AD.txt,besides they are confronted with advertising anyways for example in the supermarket or the streets or magazines.
439,439,1030_aID1AD.txt,it is hard to completly isolate children and protect them from advertising.
440,440,1030_aID1AD.txt,to come to a conclusion i am of the oppinion that with the right leading from the parents even young children could navigate through the jungle of television advertising and they will learn how to deal with it.
441,441,1030_aID1AD.txt,it is the best way to prepare kids for the future.
442,442,1030_aID1AD.txt,it isn't nedded to forbid television advertising for young children because it isn't needed to protect them from anything if they know how to protect themselves.
443,443,1031_aID1AD.txt,television advertising has a big role in modern society.
444,444,1031_aID1AD.txt,almost everything has its own advertise.
445,445,1031_aID1AD.txt,but what about toys for kids?
446,446,1031_aID1AD.txt,do they need advertises directed to them or does it has a negative effect on them?
447,447,1031_aID1AD.txt,should television advertising directed toward young children not be allowed?
448,448,1031_aID1AD.txt,"advertising has an effect on everybody, no matter if he or she is young or old."
449,449,1031_aID1AD.txt,nevertheless it's not a secret that little kids are likely to be influenced by such things.
450,450,1031_aID1AD.txt,"if a kid sees that this toy is the best, like it is said in the advertise, it believes that it is tne best."
451,451,1031_aID1AD.txt,but sometimes things are to expensives to affort for some families.
452,452,1031_aID1AD.txt,"a kid who believes only this toy is the best could be frustrated or sad if it does'nt get this toy, a situation that could be strenghten by other children who have this toy."
453,453,1031_aID1AD.txt,furthermore could the other kids begin to bully a kid who has not got the best toy like they said in the advertise.
454,454,1031_aID1AD.txt,anyway the modern world is full of advertises.
455,455,1031_aID1AD.txt,not only in tv but also in the internet at train stations or on walls in cities.
456,456,1031_aID1AD.txt,"so where is the difference between an advertise that says :""parents buy this or that for your kids because it's the best"", or if it says:""kids look, that's the best toy in the world""."
457,457,1031_aID1AD.txt,the message is the same for children.
458,458,1031_aID1AD.txt,they see this toy is the best and they want it.
459,459,1031_aID1AD.txt,especially kids aged two to five can not differentiate between advertises directed to them and advertises directed to other persons.
460,460,1031_aID1AD.txt,moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.
461,461,1031_aID1AD.txt,they have to make them clear that not everything said in television is right.
462,462,1031_aID1AD.txt,on the one hand a confrontation with this kind of advertising could be bad on the other hand children can only learn from it if they are confronted with it and learn to spectate advertising from other perspectives.
463,463,1031_aID1AD.txt,i think rather than ban advertises directed to kids from television it is more important to teach the kids how to deal with advertises.
464,464,1031_aID1AD.txt,if they'd just be abandonned the kids would never learn how to deal with things or persons that try to manipulate them.
465,465,1031_aID1AD.txt,"maybe they would even be easier influenced by populists than other persons if they did not learn howe to say :""no!"""
466,466,1034_aID1AD.txt,"nowadays, many advertisments on television feature cute toys, aiming to attract young children to want them."
467,467,1034_aID1AD.txt,"because these children are usually at a very young age, it is discussed whether to ban these ads or not."
468,468,1034_aID1AD.txt,"many parents know the struggle of their kid seeing something quite expensive and useless on tv, like a flying barby-doll or a self-destructing car."
469,469,1034_aID1AD.txt,the kids might be sad if their parents decide not to give these items to them.
470,470,1034_aID1AD.txt,"they might even become angry at them, throwing a tantrum if they want something really bad."
471,471,1034_aID1AD.txt,"this is not just bad for the atmosphere in the family itself, but could also affect the childs mental health, if they feel like they never ever get what they want the most."
472,472,1034_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand, if the kids stay nice and quiet, they might have the chance to get the thing they want for christmas."
473,473,1034_aID1AD.txt,"without the ad about it on television, they maybe would have never known that this special thing existed in the first place, and if the parents decide to give it to them for birthday or christmans, the child will be very happy."
474,474,1034_aID1AD.txt,"one cannot forget though, that children aged two to five may not have a sense for rational thinking or are conscious about money's worth at all, so they might see some completely useless and easily breakable item on tv, which they then want to have for christmas."
475,475,1034_aID1AD.txt,"and if they parents don't look up details about that item and just trust their child because it makes it happy, the child might end up with a broken toy, which will make them even more sad."
476,476,1034_aID1AD.txt,"by far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents."
477,477,1034_aID1AD.txt,"if they decide not to buy something, their kid will just forget about it after a while (we've all been there) and everything's just fine."
478,478,1034_aID1AD.txt,"and if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on tv to make them happy?"
479,479,1034_aID1AD.txt,"concluding, i'd say that ads aimed towards young children shouldn't be banned, because as one can see, really no matter what, it's always up to the parents."
480,480,1034_aID1AD.txt,"if the kids throw a tantrum, they'll get over it sooner or later."
481,481,1034_aID1AD.txt,"the ads are perhaps the best way to get to know new products, and i think the children deserve to sometimes (not always!)"
482,482,1034_aID1AD.txt,"get what they want, even if it is not the best thing to buy."
483,483,1034_aID1AD.txt,"this way, they can also learn from it and maybe develop a sense for what's good and what's not, so they can better decide what to buy for themselves when they're older."
484,484,1035_aID1AD.txt,"as technoglogy evolves more and more product selling companies find more ways to advertise their products and trick people into believing they need those products, this being achieved by making use of several psychological tricks and methods."
485,485,1035_aID1AD.txt,and since there aren't only products for adult people the focus is also on teenagers and children.
486,486,1035_aID1AD.txt,"in fact a lot of companies only sell toys for children, making this an essential part of our economy."
487,487,1035_aID1AD.txt,"but keeping in mind how companies find ways to manipulate their potential customers the question arises whether or not advertising, in particular on television, directly addressed to children should be prohibited."
488,488,1035_aID1AD.txt,"in order to support this statement one could argue and say that due to their childish minds and behaviours kids are much more easily tricked into doing an believing things than adults, making it much easier to make them want to have certain things."
489,489,1035_aID1AD.txt,"someone may take this to an extreme and say that kids' childish natures are being abused, which is highly questionable from a moralic point of view."
490,490,1035_aID1AD.txt,furthermore children influenced by tv ads are going to to try and make their parents buy those certain products which they most likely won't thus frustrating the kids and all in all causing unnecessary tears.
491,491,1035_aID1AD.txt,despite having taken the negative aspects into consideration the opposing side should have jusgt as much attention.
492,492,1035_aID1AD.txt,"so eventhough tv advertising might influence children there is no sign that it causes any major negative effects or even damgage to them, it does not hurt them after all."
493,493,1035_aID1AD.txt,has there ever been a child being seemingly damaged by wanting a new toy car?
494,494,1035_aID1AD.txt,in order to answer the question as to whether or not such tv ads should be banned or not the companies' perspectives should also be taken into consideration.
495,495,1035_aID1AD.txt,from their point of view advertising is essential to find potential customers.
496,496,1035_aID1AD.txt,"and also if they suddenly weren't allowed to show ads on tv anymore they'd surely find another way to advertise their products, for example via smartphones."
497,497,1035_aID1AD.txt,giving attention to both sides we can conclude that tv advertising should not be banned.
498,498,1036_aID1AD.txt,"the statement ""tv advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"" is about what impact ads can make to humans especially to young children."
499,499,1036_aID1AD.txt,it depends on their parents.
500,500,1036_aID1AD.txt,"if their parents are strong and do not buy their kids everything they want to have, ads will not have a big impact."
501,501,1036_aID1AD.txt,it also depends on which ads are showed.
502,502,1036_aID1AD.txt,if there are only advertises about things that kids do not need like insurances or cars no one will bat an eye.
503,503,1036_aID1AD.txt,it will get interesting when advertises are shown with kids as target.
504,504,1036_aID1AD.txt,the children will try to force their parents to buy them the things they have seen on the tv.
505,505,1036_aID1AD.txt,but if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine.
506,506,1036_aID1AD.txt,so it is very important to show the children who has the power.
507,507,1036_aID1AD.txt,in addition children from two to five are not that good in arguing.
508,508,1036_aID1AD.txt,"they will just say something like: ""i need this toy (please) buy it daddy!"""
509,509,1036_aID1AD.txt,and if the parents are smart they will tell them that they do not need it so the parents will not buy it.
510,510,1036_aID1AD.txt,"the children have no other choice than accepting this, except for begging or crying."
511,511,1036_aID1AD.txt,but if the parents stay cool and maybe ignore the children while they are crying they will soon stop doing it.
512,512,1036_aID1AD.txt,"another fact is, that some ads which children should not see are shown at night or in the late evening."
513,513,1036_aID1AD.txt,so there is no danger that children could see ads they should not see.
514,514,1036_aID1AD.txt,so i disagree with this statement because smart parents are stronger than any advertise and if they are not they should think about their role as a parent.
515,515,1037_aID1AD.txt,"if you've ever accidently switched to a tv channel for kids while watching television or have children yourself, who  watch these channels, you've probably encountered the high amount of long advertisment blocks in which products like expensive toys, sweets or lemonade are being presented."
516,516,1037_aID1AD.txt,"in today's world a lot of parents use modern media to entertain their kids, because of what it is important to question the effect of these advertisments on the younger generation, especially on the not yet developed children aged two to five."
517,517,1037_aID1AD.txt,"these ads are a big part of the marketing campaign of the toy and sweet manufacturers; banning them for being inappropriate would seriously harm these companies as there wouldn't be many ways left they could reach the kids, there target group."
518,518,1037_aID1AD.txt,"the ways left would be the internet, which is also often used by young children, and the direct advertisment in the streets."
519,519,1037_aID1AD.txt,"yet, one should consider that the advertisments are always flashy and show the happy children who use the product."
520,520,1037_aID1AD.txt,"they never show what effects the lemonade has on their health, if it is unhealthy and full of sugar."
521,521,1037_aID1AD.txt,their effect is always hidden as the parents wouldn't allow their kids to buy the advertised product.
522,522,1037_aID1AD.txt,it is wrong to sell an unhealthy product to innocent children.
523,523,1037_aID1AD.txt,also important is that the children aren't really developed yet; they haven't had many experiences with money and aren't able to decide whether the board game they wan't so badly is overpriced.
524,524,1037_aID1AD.txt,"often, the parent would give in on their child, which is not going to give up on that toy."
525,525,1037_aID1AD.txt,"considering all of these facts, it is somewhat clear, that the target group of children aged two to five isn't yet ready to be influenced and also manipulated by the toy companies."
526,526,1038_aID1AD.txt,advertisment has an big influence on our society.
527,527,1038_aID1AD.txt,it can have a big impact on how we behave and what we spend our money on.
528,528,1038_aID1AD.txt,so should young children at the age of two to five have contact with advertisment for their age already?
529,529,1038_aID1AD.txt,"first advertisment directed toward young children would be very effective, because it would reach not only the children but the parents as well."
530,530,1038_aID1AD.txt,parents are often not able to resist the wishes of their children.
531,531,1038_aID1AD.txt,that is why the profit of companies selling for example toys would rise.
532,532,1038_aID1AD.txt,futhermore advertisment is needed to inform the public about new products.
533,533,1038_aID1AD.txt,"it is important to inform the customers, buying toys, clothes and everything else for young children, about new products and innovations, too."
534,534,1038_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand young children at the age of two to five can not make their own buying decisions and they are not able to handle money.
535,535,1038_aID1AD.txt,"becauso of that it may be more effective to publish advertisment directed to middle-aged people, because they as parents decide instead of their children."
536,536,1038_aID1AD.txt,"even though young children have contact with advertisment every day, advertisment directed to them would have a bigger impact on them and their behavior."
537,537,1038_aID1AD.txt,"they also do not know about the risks in our society and whether something is good or bad, because they are just at the begining of their developement."
538,538,1038_aID1AD.txt,that is why they can be manipulated very easily.
539,539,1038_aID1AD.txt,advertisment can be developed in a way that may have a hidden influence on their opinion later.
540,540,1038_aID1AD.txt,"summarising all points i can conclude that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because of the negative impact this could have on their development and because of them being not reasonable enough to make their own decisions and to realise whether something is good or bad"
541,541,1040_aID1AD.txt,"i can understand that companies direct their advertising towards young children, because in that age, children can be manipulated very easily, and while adults and other children are better able to decide wether they actually need the advertised product, they only care about the great video and not about what the product actually is."
542,542,1040_aID1AD.txt,"and while they usually are not able to actually buy these things, they are often able to heavily influence their parents when insistin on wanting to have something."
543,543,1040_aID1AD.txt,"this means, that this kind of advertising can be very efficient, because more and more younger children watch television on a regular basis, so more and more companies direct their advertising towards this age group."
544,544,1040_aID1AD.txt,"this means that children are manipulated more and more often, and in my opinion that should not be allowed."
545,545,1040_aID1AD.txt,"when children are heavily influenced by advertising, this leads to children trying to convince their parents of buying a product much more often as they already do, and this habit puts a much greater strain on the parents, who will probably give in to their children more and more often, because they have not got the strength to have similar fights over products over and over again."
546,546,1040_aID1AD.txt,"as probably mostly sweets and things to play with are advertised, children will probably eat more sweets, which could lead to more children being overweight."
547,547,1040_aID1AD.txt,"and as people often keep eating habits when growing up, this might increase the already big problem of obesity in the future."
548,548,1040_aID1AD.txt,"additionally, parents will spent more money on sweets and mostly unneccessary things, which can be a problem in families which are not wealthy."
549,549,1040_aID1AD.txt,"therefore, i completely agree with the statement ""television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"", because forbidding this kind of advertising could reduce many problems in families."
550,550,1051_aID1AD.txt,especially young children are getting easily influenced by television.
551,551,1051_aID1AD.txt,"nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television."
552,552,1051_aID1AD.txt,the question is if this advertising should be forbidden because of the influence that it could take on young children.
553,553,1051_aID1AD.txt,"a lot of children may not be even able to understand advertising in normal television, so they would be rather nerved as influenced."
554,554,1051_aID1AD.txt,there are some products that may not be shown to children.
555,555,1051_aID1AD.txt,children should not think that alcohol is as cool as it is getting presented.
556,556,1051_aID1AD.txt,advertising on channels who are made for kids are something else - the way the product is getting presented will be a lot more interesting for a kid than for an adult.
557,557,1051_aID1AD.txt,an easy way to prevent children from this danger is a regulation of the time a child is watching tv.
558,558,1051_aID1AD.txt,too much tv time leads to a bad eyesight and maybe to a bad social abillity because of the fact that a lot of kids are watching tv for hours and hours without speaking to everyone or to get in contact with new friends or kids.
559,559,1051_aID1AD.txt,for me advertising towards young children is not a problem.
560,560,1051_aID1AD.txt,the parents should care about the time their child is sitting in front of a tv and if the child is watching something that is meant to be for his age.
561,561,1051_aID1AD.txt,imagine that there would not be advertising anymore - where is the money for the channels coming from ?
562,562,1051_aID1AD.txt,some channels would not be even able to exist.
563,563,1051_aID1AD.txt,advertising is one of the main money makers for channels and it would be a really hard challenge for some of the smaller ones to keep showing the same content as before.
564,564,1051_aID1AD.txt,"another point that can be discussed wether good or bad is, that children get inspired for their whishes on christmas."
565,565,1051_aID1AD.txt,i think this is something that can be as good as bad.
566,566,1052_aID1AD.txt,"i will arguement regarding to the statement:""television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"" in the following lines."
567,567,1052_aID1AD.txt,the television advertising directed toward children could confuse the children because they dont know how to deal with the situation.
568,568,1052_aID1AD.txt,"there could be, for example a bid teddy bear on the television, who tells the children, that they should buy him and that he is the best teddy bear, that they will ever have."
569,569,1052_aID1AD.txt,"young children aged two to five won't notice, that thos is just a pr strategie and that this teddy bear can not speak with them."
570,570,1052_aID1AD.txt,"but it is also a good train for children for learning how to deal with treat from the internet or the television, so they learn how to handle in situations like these."
571,571,1052_aID1AD.txt,"most of the time the parents can tell them, that th eteddy bear can not speak and that the things he says in television are just a lie, even if they still want the teddy bear, the spreadings from the parents are mostly deeper and more respective for the children than the ones out of the television."
572,572,1052_aID1AD.txt,"there is also a problem given by television advertisement, because a lot of children are feared by the figures or symbol in the advertisement spots (clowns, big bears,lions, etc) so they cant sleep at night and are scared to go outside."
573,573,1052_aID1AD.txt,"this is a problem for their process of growing up, because they'll always have the picture of the big clown they saw when they where four inside their head eventhough they dont notice it specially anymore, but it will still be on the inside."
574,574,1052_aID1AD.txt,"but television advertising towards children with two years is not a big problem, because the children with two years will not notice, that it is towards them and they wont notice what is going on in these advertising spots, so the parents can be calm, beecause it isnt a big problem to deal with."
575,575,1052_aID1AD.txt,"furthermore these advertising spots can bring the children to bad ideas, for example, when their parents will not buy them the bid teddy bear, they just go inside the shop and steal it, because the teddy bear said, i want you to own me or cuddle me."
576,576,1052_aID1AD.txt,there are a lot of children who get treated by those spots.
577,577,1052_aID1AD.txt,this can be a start for an criminalisation of the children.
578,578,1052_aID1AD.txt,"all in all i can say, that these advertzising spots towards children with two to five years are unnecessary and lean them to do criminal things."
579,579,1052_aID1AD.txt,"none of the children in these ages will have enough money to buy these stuff, so these spots should not be allowed."
580,580,1053_aID1AD.txt,"kids in this age canâ´t buy everything what they see on the tv, but they want to have it and talk to their parents and they will buy it."
581,581,1053_aID1AD.txt,also i think that parents have to told their children that it isnâ´t everything real what they see on tv.
582,582,1053_aID1AD.txt,"but i think children are very easy to manipulate, so on some tv channels for children there isnâ´t television advertising."
583,583,1053_aID1AD.txt,for example the german tv channel 'kika'.
584,584,1053_aID1AD.txt,"also children donâ´t know the risks of television advertising, they have to learn it when they will grow up."
585,585,1053_aID1AD.txt,another aspect is that children believe in everything what they see.
586,586,1053_aID1AD.txt,"for example they see on the tv that you are cooler if you eat 'fruchtzwerge', children want to have 'fruchtzwerge'."
587,587,1053_aID1AD.txt,in this case parents have no choice and will buy the thing the children want to have.
588,588,1053_aID1AD.txt,"so i think that television advertising toward young children should be not allowed, because they are too young and can be manipulate."
589,589,1053_aID1AD.txt,"but companys earn a lot of money with this television advertising, so it would be hard to forbidden televison advertising toward young children."
590,590,1055_aID1AD.txt,sould advertising directed to young children (aged two to five) be allowed or not?
591,591,1055_aID1AD.txt,this is a very controversial question and it is hard to decide between yes and no.
592,592,1055_aID1AD.txt,"i would like to evaluate the two options and come to a conclusion, answer or solution."
593,593,1055_aID1AD.txt,a lot of people believe that it is unethical to introduce children to the world of this kind of economy at the age of two years.
594,594,1055_aID1AD.txt,these young children should not bother about whether they want a pink barbie doll or a blue pegasus-unicorn just from looking at television advertisements because they could have been influenced too much.
595,595,1055_aID1AD.txt,it might be possible that they donâ´t even want some of the things shown in the advertisement but beg their parents anyways just because theyâ´ve seen it on tv.
596,596,1055_aID1AD.txt,"sure, there are other people who say that thats the concept of advertising but most people do not want to buy some things to their children and experience that they donâ´t use it or play with it."
597,597,1055_aID1AD.txt,another argument against advertising directed to children is that it might not be worth it for some companies to direct it to children.
598,598,1055_aID1AD.txt,not many children watch television at the age of two or donâ´t understand the content of the advertisement.
599,599,1055_aID1AD.txt,that sounds like the companies that make adverts for children lose more money by putting the advertisement on national television than for actually selling the product.
600,600,1055_aID1AD.txt,"however, the parents of the young children might want to buy some of the products because they believe that they are good for their toddlers and that they might enjoy it."
601,601,1055_aID1AD.txt,"seen from this angle, those television spots arenâ´t directly produced for young children but more for parents of young children."
602,602,1055_aID1AD.txt,i belive that television advertisements should not be directed toward young children because i believe that it is just a waste of money and time for the companies that decide to produce a  television advertisement because i belive that young children donâ´t need to watch television and they shouldnâ´t be talked into  things they donâ´t truly want.
603,603,1055_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion, advertisements can be directed to children aged five and older because i believe they can handle the input of information better that chikdren younger than five."
604,604,1056_aID1AD.txt,"i will talk about the statement ""television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five)should not be allowed"", in the following essay."
605,605,1056_aID1AD.txt,"in our generation it is normal that children have a mobile phone and a ""i pad"" or something like this."
606,606,1056_aID1AD.txt,when they do not have the best of the best they were uncool and sometimes they get bullied by other children.
607,607,1056_aID1AD.txt,"the parents try to get them back to the old times, like playing in the garden or reading a book."
608,608,1056_aID1AD.txt,"when i was 5 years old i`d love to play with my friends or with my babyborn.furthermore, i do not even really now what happens around the world or what televison can be."
609,609,1056_aID1AD.txt,sometimes i watched movies for children but never a ducumentary.
610,610,1056_aID1AD.txt,"nowadays, children at this age have their own tv in their room and there are many shows whitch are not good for them or things they can not understand at this age."
611,611,1056_aID1AD.txt,"moreover, they here something about political stuff in the trash tv and they think it is right if its not adressed to them."
612,612,1056_aID1AD.txt,"so, firstly the positive thing is that the children can learn something about the world very early and they do not need to talk to their parents or read a book but thats really sad, for me."
613,613,1056_aID1AD.txt,"indeed, the show were adressed to children and so there would be a lenguage for this age to understand and the surrounding would be great to see."
614,614,1056_aID1AD.txt,but children will watch this the whole time and do not even know how to read a letter or a book.
615,615,1056_aID1AD.txt,"likewise, i agree with the point that it should not be allowed."
616,616,1056_aID1AD.txt,"yes, children need education but in the age of two to five they are to young."
617,617,1056_aID1AD.txt,they do not must know this stuff and they do not buy anything.
618,618,1056_aID1AD.txt,"so, they should play or read and for me this tv advertisings should be allowed at the age of 12 because there you can start to think about what they talk about."
619,619,1056_aID1AD.txt,some people say that children need as much education as they could get but not at this age.
620,620,1056_aID1AD.txt,think about your childhood ?
621,621,1056_aID1AD.txt,can you imagine to watch and important is to understand what the people what from you in this advertising.
622,622,1056_aID1AD.txt,"at this moment, i totally agree with this statement and it should not be allowed, everything else is to much for this children."
623,623,1056_aID1AD.txt,"also, when it is adressed to this children we do not know if they show bullshit there so the parents were not happy when they see the trash but i must tell at least that the children would only watch this shows and not everything else what is badly for them to see like a horror movie."
624,624,1056_aID1AD.txt,but that did not change my opnion!
625,625,1057_aID1AD.txt,"for first it should be said, that a directive like this propably never will happen to the television, because would getâ´s more and more digital."
626,626,1057_aID1AD.txt,but thinking of the consequenses of some kind of television this might be a good way to keep that kind of stuff away form this young children.
627,627,1057_aID1AD.txt,for example psychomovies ore some thrillers or actionmovies.
628,628,1057_aID1AD.txt,"this basically has nothing to do with the normal programm young children watch today, but if they get used to watch tv every days since they are maybe 3 years old they might start watching this kind of movie ways earlier then they should."
629,629,1057_aID1AD.txt,"another problem could be that this children might have some problems to make friends later bcause they are so used to watch tv all the day that they maybe keep doing this when
 theâ´re already in school."
630,630,1057_aID1AD.txt,"even there school grades would be a problem if they are just watching tv all day on regular basis, and do not learn vokabularies or for some class testâ´s."
631,631,1057_aID1AD.txt,on the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach tv even at a so young age.
632,632,1057_aID1AD.txt,for exapmle there are several knowlegde shows for kids on tv they can watch to learn a bit more about the world and some other things that might be interesting for them.
633,633,1057_aID1AD.txt,this is an easy way for these kids to get some general knowledge and gives there parents some time to do other things then working or having a look at what there child is doing.
634,634,1057_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion there is no way that the gouvernment ore anyone else then the parents can say how much and when there children are allowed to watch tv.
635,635,1057_aID1AD.txt,"i  do think that there are to many children watching allot to much tv nowerdays but as i said, the important thing is to show the maybe futural parents what could happen if they do not handle this problem."
636,636,1057_aID1AD.txt,"but according to the specific statement from the adversiting i say no it should be allowed, because if the parent regulate the tv usage of there children right it has allot of advantages for there further live."
637,637,1059_aID1AD.txt,many of aus us it every day.
638,638,1059_aID1AD.txt,and there are critics an people which see a chance in the using of this new technology.
639,639,1059_aID1AD.txt,but is it ok to give that high technology devices to children aged two to five?
640,640,1059_aID1AD.txt,or shouldnt it be allowed to give them to young children?
641,641,1059_aID1AD.txt,i can see this situation very often for example in my family or also on public places.
642,642,1059_aID1AD.txt,the poblem with this is that the children cant imagin that its not real what they see.
643,643,1059_aID1AD.txt,and its the same with tv advertising.
644,644,1059_aID1AD.txt,"when the children with two years lern to do the things from the tv advertising, they maybe start smoking with twelve years."
645,645,1059_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand the advertising could help the parents find out what the children want.
646,646,1059_aID1AD.txt,e. g. for present for the birthday or christmas.
647,647,1059_aID1AD.txt,but there are also prospects.
648,648,1059_aID1AD.txt,i thing that the young generation shouldnt see the advertisment on the tv for themselve.
649,649,1059_aID1AD.txt,"but when the companies will be allowed to make advertising spots only for young children the parents are able to take of the tv or when teh children see something, the parents decide if they buy the product or not, because they are in the need of paying it."
650,650,1059_aID1AD.txt,personally i think that the television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five.
651,651,1059_aID1AD.txt,the advertisment should also expect the consumer to buy and that are in this age the parents.
652,652,1060_aID1AD.txt,"in the following essay we are going to discuss the statement, whether it should be allowed to show television advertisment, which are focused on children between two and five years old or not."
653,653,1060_aID1AD.txt,"on the one side it should be allowed to show such as these advertisments, because the children are more informed, what is in trend and can compare with other children."
654,654,1060_aID1AD.txt,"they usually don't read newspaper or magazines, so they can see things from the televeision."
655,655,1060_aID1AD.txt,but there are many problems if children see advertisments which are focused on them.
656,656,1060_aID1AD.txt,the brain of children in this age is not so developed like a brain of an youth or an adult.
657,657,1060_aID1AD.txt,children can also be influenced more easily by different things.
658,658,1060_aID1AD.txt,"if you tell a child that santa clause exists, it will believe."
659,659,1060_aID1AD.txt,but an adult knows that it is not true.
660,660,1060_aID1AD.txt,they also do not have this critical thinking of things that adults have.
661,661,1060_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion it should be not allowed to show tv advertisments for children between two and five.
662,662,1060_aID1AD.txt,"they see something colourful, beautiful, etc."
663,663,1060_aID1AD.txt,and for them it seems to be the best thing in the world.
664,664,1060_aID1AD.txt,they will annoy their parents to buy this thing.
665,665,1060_aID1AD.txt,"tv ads are just made to manipulate a child's brain, because of the straightforward thinking."
666,666,1060_aID1AD.txt,in todays' life it is very difficult to keep children away from electronic media.
667,667,1060_aID1AD.txt,because everyone has a tv or something similar in his home.
668,668,1060_aID1AD.txt,so the advertisment companies use this as an advantage and manipulate a child's brain.
669,669,1061_aID1AD.txt,now i will count on some arguments for the statement.
670,670,1061_aID1AD.txt,television should not be allowed for young children because they would see pictures they don't understand and which are not made for young childs.
671,671,1061_aID1AD.txt,"they shouldn't see that pictures, because they could be afraid of things they should not afraid of, like zombies in a horrormovie."
672,672,1061_aID1AD.txt,"additionally they need the time to play outside and experiance the world and they can't do that because the tv is always more interrestic for young children, it' normal."
673,673,1061_aID1AD.txt,furthermore young children could start of having an unreal view of the world because they just see the suggerested pictures in the television and don't try to find it out themself.
674,674,1061_aID1AD.txt,"so in this important time for a child to grow up and learn things they should do it without tv, because it's an lonely live with just watching tv and they need the social links."
675,675,1061_aID1AD.txt,otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching tv.
676,676,1061_aID1AD.txt,they just need to switch it on and they are in a new world where they can see what they want and expriance what they want.
677,677,1061_aID1AD.txt,"the television is part of our future, so why don't tell them early how to use it?"
678,678,1061_aID1AD.txt,"the televison additionally could make friends or link familys, because it connects people."
679,679,1061_aID1AD.txt,"if they watch a funny quiz or if the watch a dramatic dokumentation, they do something together and that's the point."
680,680,1061_aID1AD.txt,in my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.
681,681,1061_aID1AD.txt,for example once a week an doumentation which is specially made for young children is good to learn something and learn what the tv is.
682,682,1061_aID1AD.txt,anything more than this makes the points i wrote about the bad things on tv come true.
683,683,1063_aID1AD.txt,"i agree with this statement  becouse young children shoud go out side and not in the hous.when a young child often befor the tv sit,he donâ´t  can do frendchips  with other children  in his older."
684,684,1063_aID1AD.txt,the sozial aspekt is in this  moment very importent because when your child is the hole day in the hous becaus his tv show  is there  and when he is older so he donâ´t know  how he shold speak with other people in his older .
685,685,1063_aID1AD.txt,"maybe they could watch tv but not the hole day and not when the weather is goog and you go outside ,but when the weather is bad an you donâ´t can go outside you musst play with your  playtoies and when he is older he know a litle bit what is good and what is bad."
686,686,1064_aID1AD.txt,"now i will discuss, if television adversiting directed toward young children should not be allowed."
687,687,1064_aID1AD.txt,today there is a television in each family and the parents and the adults in the family are watching tv.
688,688,1064_aID1AD.txt,children in the age between two and five spent almost all there time after the kindergarden with his mother or father.
689,689,1064_aID1AD.txt,"in the evening adults often watch tv and if the children are not going to bed so early, they are sometimes watching tv with their parents."
690,690,1064_aID1AD.txt,"in the programm for adults the tv often adverts direct to the audience, but today also the kids channel do that."
691,691,1064_aID1AD.txt,the children maybe see a new toy and happy children says that it is so cool.
692,692,1064_aID1AD.txt,every child would want the toy.
693,693,1064_aID1AD.txt,"that is a problem because parents do not want unhappy childreen and then they have to say to their child, he would not get the toy."
694,694,1064_aID1AD.txt,"a nother probolem is that often the ""werbung"" manipulates the audience."
695,695,1064_aID1AD.txt,for example playmobil: there is a child playing with the new playmobil castle and there is a dragon which can act.
696,696,1064_aID1AD.txt,it can spy fire or is flying in the clouds.
697,697,1064_aID1AD.txt,"in the reality that is not possible, but younger children would trust the television and think it is real."
698,698,1064_aID1AD.txt,"then when they get the new playmobil dragon and want to the it spying fire, they are sad becaus they thought it works."
699,699,1064_aID1AD.txt,"i agree with the statement because i think if young children are watching tv, the television should not adverts direct toward to the chidren."
700,700,1065_aID1AD.txt,television advertising directed toward young children can be allowed.
701,701,1065_aID1AD.txt,on the one hand there are many reasons to support an advertising free tv programm.
702,702,1065_aID1AD.txt,"first children in this age even do not understand, what advertising means and, how it can influence them in a bad way."
703,703,1065_aID1AD.txt,that's why parents have to keep an eye on their children during their watching period.
704,704,1065_aID1AD.txt,"not every parent is able to do so, because they can have lots of work outside the living room."
705,705,1065_aID1AD.txt,"in addition to that, there is the question wether showing advertising and influence them is moralic right or not."
706,706,1065_aID1AD.txt,"because it isn't not really neccessary for the once, who want to advertise their products."
707,707,1065_aID1AD.txt,"and why should someone pay so much money just to show such things like toys to children, who sometimes even can't talk in their age."
708,708,1065_aID1AD.txt,"but one the other hand they can learn new things like new words or something about food just by seeing it, because they do not see such things in their movies."
709,709,1065_aID1AD.txt,advertising keeps contact to the reality while fictional movies don't.
710,710,1065_aID1AD.txt,"also there is the chance, e.g."
711,711,1065_aID1AD.txt,"when there is tv advertising for a specific toy, that the children like it and the parents can buy it to them."
712,712,1065_aID1AD.txt,"and it helps parents to confirm their young children to turn the tv off, because there will be a five minute break full of advertising, which is boring to see, anyway."
713,713,1065_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion it's not neccessary to show little children television advertising, but it doesn't have to be canceled."
714,714,1065_aID1AD.txt,"the parents have to decide, what is the best for their children."
715,715,1066_aID1AD.txt,"essay

in our technical world the television in a big part of our life."
716,716,1066_aID1AD.txt,espacilly younger children get influenced a lot by these media.
717,717,1066_aID1AD.txt,so is it a good idea to confront this young children already in this age with television advertising?
718,718,1066_aID1AD.txt,as in verios studies proven young children get more influenced by any kind of adverting than young adults or older people.
719,719,1066_aID1AD.txt,these young children are very naive and so it is very hard for them to understand what is the truth and what is not in the tv.
720,720,1066_aID1AD.txt,"also would a children try to buy everything, which is showen in the tv, because they just want to have everything."
721,721,1066_aID1AD.txt,and this were the parents have to do their work and sometimes have to say no.
722,722,1066_aID1AD.txt,for example when the children wants to buy a knife.
723,723,1066_aID1AD.txt,but as alreday mentioned before we life in a techinical world and to understand and to life in this world every people need the skills on how to handel advertising.
724,724,1066_aID1AD.txt,because it is such an important skill it is important that the next generation lears this skill very fast.
725,725,1066_aID1AD.txt,and there is no place better than in your family over a long period of time.
726,726,1066_aID1AD.txt,"of cause some content is just not right for children like zigarets, alkohol or other kinds of violent games."
727,727,1066_aID1AD.txt,these advertisements should not be allowed to see in the television befor eight at night.
728,728,1066_aID1AD.txt,"so all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed."
729,729,1066_aID1AD.txt,"but advertisement is a allday thing so if they would not see it on the tv they would see it in the streets, radio and big city."
730,730,1066_aID1AD.txt,so for me banning direct advertisement is not the right way.
731,731,1067_aID1AD.txt,in the following essay i'm going to discuss the statement that it shouldn't be allowed to show advertising content to children below 5 years of age.
732,732,1067_aID1AD.txt,"if you look at the statement, you can see that it only means ""television advertising""."
733,733,1067_aID1AD.txt,"the most advertises are related to the content that is sent between those advertises, so in a show for young children there won't be a car advertise for example."
734,734,1067_aID1AD.txt,the people making this advertising will try to guess what kind of people will watch their content so they catch the right crowd which probably buys this kind of things.
735,735,1067_aID1AD.txt,"if you look at the financial part, the tv channels also have to make some money to run their business and the content shown."
736,736,1067_aID1AD.txt,"if i combine those facts and if the advertising content shown to the children is nothing harmful, my opinion of showing television ads to younger people is that they are okay in a way of financing the channel."
737,737,1067_aID1AD.txt,"but i also think that if kids see too many nice things on tv they like, they may will be way too greedy on those things which their parents might not even be able to afford."
738,738,1067_aID1AD.txt,"they shouldn't be teached to that much consuming like it's often shown on the television, but it's not that bad if they don't see too much tv and advertising at all."
739,739,1067_aID1AD.txt,"so if their parents are sitting right beside them and are also looking at the stuff their children watch, the tv can be switched off when an ad comes and parents can protect the kids from unsuitable content or advertising."
740,740,1067_aID1AD.txt,"but they should keep in mind that if they don't watch it between the ages of 2 and 5, they might watch it after that, and for sure parents can't keep an eye on everything their children see; the modern world is just too full of that, not even on tv but also at the streets, radio or newspapers."
741,741,1068_aID1AD.txt,the question if children between two and five should be the audience of adverstising is difficult.
742,742,1068_aID1AD.txt,young children are very easy to control and to influence.
743,743,1068_aID1AD.txt,"if they see something, they are not capible of nmaking up an own opinion."
744,744,1068_aID1AD.txt,that is why advertising on telvision in between kids program is not good.
745,745,1068_aID1AD.txt,"children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product."
746,746,1068_aID1AD.txt,then  the parents are in the situation to forbid their children something the television says they are allowed to get.
747,747,1068_aID1AD.txt,"but in the most televion channels for kids, there is less advertising in the morning, when espiaclliy children age two to five watch teelvision."
748,748,1068_aID1AD.txt,"there is less of an optertunity for them to see advertising, so the question is if there really is television adcertising direceted to only this age group."
749,749,1068_aID1AD.txt,still there is the chance of seeing advertising and the wish rises of getting more and more toys.
750,750,1068_aID1AD.txt,"the value of one product gets less, because of the high onsume."
751,751,1068_aID1AD.txt,i think it is not right to manipulate children through advertising.
752,752,1068_aID1AD.txt,"even though they might get the product, advertising is not all about reality and the child might get disappointed."
753,753,1068_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand children get conftonted with advertising daily.
754,754,1068_aID1AD.txt,"even when the television is turned of, there are enough adverts in kids magazines or on big posters wich are hung up all over the place."
755,755,1068_aID1AD.txt,"the child can not not see the newest products, that his parents should buy."
756,756,1068_aID1AD.txt,"but the problem with television advertising is, that you do not have to know how to read the posters or buy the magazine."
757,757,1068_aID1AD.txt,"it is free to turn on the television and watch at all the concerns, wich try to sell their ""newest"" and ""best"" product to little kids wich do not know better."
758,758,1068_aID1AD.txt,i think that not allowing television advertising directed to children aged two to five would not make such a big of a change.
759,759,1068_aID1AD.txt,our whole society is about buying and selling - consuming.
760,760,1068_aID1AD.txt,you can not protect you child fully and forever.
761,761,1068_aID1AD.txt,but i do think that we have to start somewhere.
762,762,1068_aID1AD.txt,we can not ban all posters and magazines.
763,763,1068_aID1AD.txt,but we can decide wich shows and programs our child should watch.
764,764,1068_aID1AD.txt,"in shows like ""toggolino"" or "" zdftivi"" there is no advertising in the morning."
765,765,1068_aID1AD.txt,"as a kid i watched ""sandmann"" in the evening and there was no advertising aswell."
766,766,1068_aID1AD.txt,"so no, it should not be a law or a rule for all channels to not show advertising."
767,767,1068_aID1AD.txt,"but in the primetime for younger children to watch television, it should be at least reduced."
768,768,1068_aID1AD.txt,to ban it completitly will not stop the child from beeing influenced by adverts.
769,769,1076_aID1AD.txt,our society is made of consumers and sellers.
770,770,1076_aID1AD.txt,we have the urge to make economics.
771,771,1076_aID1AD.txt,we also seem to be in a battle with other people.
772,772,1076_aID1AD.txt,who is better at selling?
773,773,1076_aID1AD.txt,we are living in a world where technology affects our daily life and where we are dependent on it.
774,774,1076_aID1AD.txt,this could  be the reason why we create televion advertising.
775,775,1076_aID1AD.txt,"however, not only adults are effected by advertisments also young children who cannot differ between information and manipulation."
776,776,1076_aID1AD.txt,so should television advertising directed toward young children be forbidden?
777,777,1076_aID1AD.txt,in this paragraph you will read arguments why commercials for children should be unallowed.
778,778,1076_aID1AD.txt,at the young age of three or four children are starting to develope the conciousness about themself.
779,779,1076_aID1AD.txt,thex figure out that if they say 'i' they are meaning themself.
780,780,1076_aID1AD.txt,at this age of confusing realizations children can be manipulated very easily.
781,781,1076_aID1AD.txt,because they are unenlightened they obey what the growns ups say.
782,782,1076_aID1AD.txt,even if they are in a television.
783,783,1076_aID1AD.txt,that is why it could be unmoral wanting to convince children to buy a product or even be something they later would not chose to  be.
784,784,1076_aID1AD.txt,"furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general."
785,785,1076_aID1AD.txt,"so what sense would it make to advertise towards children, if they cannot determine to buy something if the intention is not brainwashing?"
786,786,1076_aID1AD.txt,"especially advertisment about special group of people like parties or organisations could be dangerous for children, since also adults gets convinced by them and start to think that it is not bad to treat people with certain skin colours or religions worse than other people."
787,787,1076_aID1AD.txt,"however, there is a reason why maybe advertising toward children should not be forbidde."
788,788,1076_aID1AD.txt,"although children cannot decide what is good and what is bad for them, they have opinions."
789,789,1076_aID1AD.txt,by forbidden television advertising one would take a away the right of children to make up their own opinions and discover a capitalistic world.
790,790,1076_aID1AD.txt,"if that is not enough reason, one could also claim that companies should have the right to advertise."
791,791,1076_aID1AD.txt,everybody should have the freedom to be what they want to be unless they harm other people.
792,792,1076_aID1AD.txt,yet they do not harm children by advertising their products.
793,793,1076_aID1AD.txt,they only show them a possibility.
794,794,1076_aID1AD.txt,and every children should have the right to have possibilities and chances.
795,795,1076_aID1AD.txt,by hiding commercials it would mean to hide a whole society.
796,796,1076_aID1AD.txt,and that could be even worse.
797,797,1076_aID1AD.txt,"to put it briefly, television advertising can be dangerous for children since they cannot decide what is good or bad for them."
798,798,1076_aID1AD.txt,they are unenlightened and do not question absolutes.
799,799,1076_aID1AD.txt,"however, companies should have the freedom to promote their products no matter what age the consumers are as much as children should be seen as person with own opinions."
800,800,1076_aID1AD.txt,"moreover, people should stop wanting to hide the possibilities that are offered, and this does not only refer to television advertisements."
801,801,1076_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion, people should not have the urge to protect children from everything."
802,802,1076_aID1AD.txt,"it sounds harsh but we have to accept that there are people in the world that will use us, they will manipulate us."
803,803,1076_aID1AD.txt,but it does not make it any better if we try to hide it in front of children.
804,804,1076_aID1AD.txt,we should rather inform them.
805,805,1076_aID1AD.txt,television advertising directed tword young children is a little step into a world that acknowlegdes problems and give every one the choice to believe what commercials say or not.
806,806,1077_aID1AD.txt,"we live in the 21th century, the century where electronic stuff and internet media gets more and more important."
807,807,1077_aID1AD.txt,the next generations will grow up with this media like its for them such a normal thing.
808,808,1077_aID1AD.txt,"in the following text i will discuss the thesis, if television advertising directred toward young children should be or not be allowed."
809,809,1077_aID1AD.txt,"if we'd go 50 years back in the past, we would see that kids and young adults had more complications to look up things."
810,810,1077_aID1AD.txt,they had to go to a library to look up informations.
811,811,1077_aID1AD.txt,also for young aged children it could be helpful.
812,812,1077_aID1AD.txt,in the past and also in my generation we learned things very early with plays or childrenbooks.
813,813,1077_aID1AD.txt,the coming and existing media will open new and in a few things much easier oppurtunities to get something in mind of a young kid.
814,814,1077_aID1AD.txt,apps are a good example for that.
815,815,1077_aID1AD.txt,"there are existing lots of apps to let the young children understand few things, that they can bring in experience in their age and this the apps try to message in a way of playing games."
816,816,1077_aID1AD.txt,but do we need that?
817,817,1077_aID1AD.txt,do a children in the age of 2-5 need media or apps to get something in his or her mind?
818,818,1077_aID1AD.txt,"just ten years back in the past the young children went outside to meet the nature and learn things about it, they played outside and had toys to understand some first easy things."
819,819,1077_aID1AD.txt,"also social contacts are very important, vor allem when youre a young kid."
820,820,1077_aID1AD.txt,"the first steps are important to know how you deal with your social area (family,friends)."
821,821,1077_aID1AD.txt,"i agree with the statement, that television should not be allowed toward young children."
822,822,1077_aID1AD.txt,"sure, the media brings new oppurtunities and easier ways to bring something in the mind of somebody with it, but i do not think that a e.g 2-years old children need media to understand the first things of life."
823,823,1077_aID1AD.txt,"it is more important that it can get the first social contacts, can go outside and play with other kids."
824,824,1078_aID1AD.txt,in the follwing text i deal with the topic of adds for young children(aged two to five) and at the end i will give my own opion.
825,825,1078_aID1AD.txt,i'd like to start with the argument that he young kids are getting perpeard if they watch adverter in that young age.
826,826,1078_aID1AD.txt,becouse in that time children doen't watch allone tv they often have they farther or mother next to them.
827,827,1078_aID1AD.txt,so that they can controlle how long they kids are watching tv.
828,828,1078_aID1AD.txt,i'd like to add to this po a new point i want to manshen is the fact of the industie behind this add.
829,829,1078_aID1AD.txt,that mean that compernies can make a lot of money with the slots for this add's .
830,830,1078_aID1AD.txt,and that mean that the channel have more money to produce a better tv shows.
831,831,1078_aID1AD.txt,that would also help the children that they dont need to watch bad tv.
832,832,1078_aID1AD.txt,on he other side is the argument that it isn't good for yound kids to watch more the 30 min a week tv.
833,833,1078_aID1AD.txt,but this add maked for the would inspirat them to watch more.
834,834,1078_aID1AD.txt,also they aren't the one how goes in the supermarked and bought the thinks promoted in this adds.
835,835,1078_aID1AD.txt,for example the two years old kids see a add for ice cream in the tv them this kid would a ask this parend that is that ?
836,836,1078_aID1AD.txt,- becouse they dont know that  is in the add.
837,837,1078_aID1AD.txt,and if they knnow that it is they would just ask can you bought me that or this ?
838,838,1078_aID1AD.txt,so the parent need to dicisde.
839,839,1078_aID1AD.txt,all in all i wouldn't allowed advertising in tv for young children becouse of the strong aspects meanshen earlyer.
840,840,1079_aID1AD.txt,in the following text i am going to write a discussion about the statement if television advertising directed towards young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
841,841,1079_aID1AD.txt,on the one hand you can say that it should be allowed because there are many products or toys that are helpful for children in this age.
842,842,1079_aID1AD.txt,they learn things from them like how to behave in some situations.
843,843,1079_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand you can say that some of those toys and products are extremly fictional.
844,844,1079_aID1AD.txt,because the children learn so much from them and sometimes want to be just like the character they are playing with they often try to do thing like them but are not able to do so because they are humans.
845,845,1079_aID1AD.txt,another example why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is that those children can choos which products they want to use or which toys they want to play with.
846,846,1079_aID1AD.txt,all in all i would say that television advertising toward young children (aged two to five) should be allowed as long as the products or toys are helpful for children in this age so they can learn from them.
847,847,1080_aID1AD.txt,televison advertising to children between two to five - a controversal topic which is often discussed.
848,848,1080_aID1AD.txt,in the following text i am going to explain some arguments in favour and against the topic to get an answer.
849,849,1080_aID1AD.txt,first of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us.
850,850,1080_aID1AD.txt,but the influcene of advertisment directed toward younger children is probably even higher.
851,851,1080_aID1AD.txt,they do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use - convincing people to buy the product.
852,852,1080_aID1AD.txt,"for example a young boy who maybe already has a lot of cars sees advertisment on a new one, the advertisment tells him that this car is way better then all others - the boy will probably believe that and will feel the need to get this car."
853,853,1080_aID1AD.txt,while an adult is maybe going to understand that there is no need for this new car because the boy already has a lot and the new car is not better at all.
854,854,1080_aID1AD.txt,another point ist that when young kids see advertisment about new products everyday they will not be satisfied about what they have because they always see that there are new and better products.
855,855,1080_aID1AD.txt,one point against this two arguments is that this unsatisfaction and the feel to need the new product is not just by young kids also grown-ups can feel that way because of advertisment.
856,856,1080_aID1AD.txt,another point ist that there is not just advertisment on television but also in the shops or by games on smartphones.
857,857,1080_aID1AD.txt,for example at a game with little monsters there maybe is advertisment for the monsters as figures to buy.
858,858,1080_aID1AD.txt,such advertisment is also not directed to adults but to younger children.
859,859,1080_aID1AD.txt,and in our society it is not unusal to play with smartphones even at an young age.
860,860,1080_aID1AD.txt,summing all up i think it is clear that advertisment is not good for younger children but we cannot do a lot against it.
861,861,1080_aID1AD.txt,advertisment is everywhere and even if parents do not let their kids watch tv or play on smartphones the children will get in contact with advertisment you cannot protect children from it.
862,862,1080_aID1AD.txt,the only thing we can do is to teach younger children that they do not need everything shown by advertisment and to think critical about the facts told by advertisment and maybe for this it is even better to start at a young age because advertisment belongs to our everyday life.
863,863,1105_aID1AD.txt,"every time we turn on the television we can watch a lot of interesting films, but also a lot of advertisments."
864,864,1105_aID1AD.txt,"these are influenicing us in every age, especially when we are young."
865,865,1105_aID1AD.txt,"children, who are aged two to five, are in a period of life where they learn a lot of things which they need for their further life and it's not that unusual that they ask questions beginning with ""why""."
866,866,1105_aID1AD.txt,so i'm going to talk about the question if television advertising toward young children should be allowed or not.
867,867,1105_aID1AD.txt,young children can be influenced easily.
868,868,1105_aID1AD.txt,"many of us remember the series we liked as a child, but also the other things we saw in television."
869,869,1105_aID1AD.txt,"so when we saw something we liked, we wanted to see more and wanted to have it."
870,870,1105_aID1AD.txt,so it's not a surprise that the toys we saw in the advertisments were laying under the tree on christmas or were given to us on our birthdays.
871,871,1105_aID1AD.txt,"children want to have many things they see, even more when they are looking exciting and interesting and many parents want to give them what they want to make them happy or just to stop them being annoying and exhausting."
872,872,1105_aID1AD.txt,the advertisments are manipulation the children by attract their interesting and showing the product as a great and exciting thing which it needs to have.
873,873,1105_aID1AD.txt,for this reason i'd forbid advertisments for children in a young age.
874,874,1105_aID1AD.txt,but one the other hand the parents still have to decide what they are going to buy and even if they are letting them watch television.
875,875,1105_aID1AD.txt,"especially around christmas are toys advertised very much, because the people need presents for their families and friends and when a child see toys and books and computer games everywhere it's not surprising that asks it's parents for more than one christmas present."
876,876,1105_aID1AD.txt,this time is very good for the economy.
877,877,1105_aID1AD.txt,"summarized i can say that young children can be influenced easily by advertisments, so they want to have more and more."
878,878,1105_aID1AD.txt,but on the other hand the parents are still deciding what they are going buy and if they are letting them watch television at all and in the most cases the children have to accept their decision.
879,879,1105_aID1AD.txt,also it's good for the economy if they are buying toys and other stuff for their children.
880,880,1105_aID1AD.txt,for this reason i disagree with the statement.
881,881,1111_aID1AD.txt,"i agree with the following statement ""television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed""."
882,882,1111_aID1AD.txt,young children must not the advertising while they are watching a movie or something like this.
883,883,1111_aID1AD.txt,it is not good when young children watch too much television.
884,884,1111_aID1AD.txt,so without advertising the movie is not so long and the kids can play outside.
885,885,1111_aID1AD.txt,for example: the child watch always television and is in the house it can get ill because the body is not so strong when a disease is in school or childgarden.
886,886,1111_aID1AD.txt,in the garden they can get stronger!
887,887,1111_aID1AD.txt,often the advertising is full of crap from electronical stuff like a flying barbie or something lika that.
888,888,1111_aID1AD.txt,when they watch television and there comes an advertising they see something and the parents have to say: no you can`t get it.
889,889,1111_aID1AD.txt,but it can be useful if young children have no idea for birthday or chrismas.
890,890,1111_aID1AD.txt,so they can inspire their selfe with the advertising.
891,891,1111_aID1AD.txt,chrismas is coming but their is no idea.
892,892,1111_aID1AD.txt,so they can watch one hour television and then they now many things.
893,893,1111_aID1AD.txt,but only children who are older than four should do this.
894,894,1111_aID1AD.txt,for younger children television is not good.
895,895,1111_aID1AD.txt,"it is okay when they see a little passage from a movie but not longer than ten minutes, without advertising!"
896,896,1111_aID1AD.txt,later they get bored from adverts and eat some chips in the break because they don`t enjoy the advertising and they become too fat.
897,897,1111_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion too much television or advertising is bad for young children.
898,898,1111_aID1AD.txt,they become stupid and want all things from advertising.
899,899,1111_aID1AD.txt,later in school they want watching always television and all the things from the advertising and they get bad marks at school.
900,900,1111_aID1AD.txt,so it is important to regulate the time sitting in front of the tv and watching adverts.
901,901,1111_aID1AD.txt,while their is advertising the parent have to talk with their children.
902,902,1111_aID1AD.txt,the advertising in television should be regulate from the people who make the tv-program.
903,903,1111_aID1AD.txt,the best way is when the parents regulate the watching time and also what they watch!
904,904,1112_aID1AD.txt,concerning the question whether there should be television advertisement directed towards young children personally believe that they should not be made.
905,905,1112_aID1AD.txt,this is due to the fact that young children are not yet able to tell apart between an advertisement and reality.
906,906,1112_aID1AD.txt,this problem has already been adressed in the film and gaming industry for example by introducing age restrictions.
907,907,1112_aID1AD.txt,while the problem in advertisement is not mature content it can still cause problems.
908,908,1112_aID1AD.txt,this is due to the nature of advertisement especially that which is directed towards young children.
909,909,1112_aID1AD.txt,those ads are mostly colourful and show the product to be far more alive than it actually is while also giving it abilities which their real counterparts do not have.
910,910,1112_aID1AD.txt,while an adult knows that the things depicted in an ad are only big exaggerations of the truth a child might think of them as true.
911,911,1112_aID1AD.txt,this is simply because of a childs nature of still having lots of fantasy which only adds onto the graphics shown in the ad.
912,912,1112_aID1AD.txt,companies of course know these things as well which is the reason for creation of such ads in the first place meaning they willingly exploit the childrens fantasy for personal profit.
913,913,1112_aID1AD.txt,lastly a possible threat those ads may pose might be that the ads might lead children to believe they had certain abilities which could cause them to unknowingly kill themselves.
914,914,1112_aID1AD.txt,to sum up i would say that adds for young children should be prohibited from being played on tv as they exploit the missing characteristics in children to make them want to have things.
915,915,1112_aID1AD.txt,the reason why this is especially important for tv adds is the fact that the medium of television allows creators to manipulate children into thinking a toy has way more abilities then it has in reality.
916,916,1113_aID1AD.txt,"i agree with the following statement, that television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed."
917,917,1113_aID1AD.txt,in my oppininon television in gerneral is not good for kids betwen the age from two to five.
918,918,1113_aID1AD.txt,watching television in that young age could not be good for them.
919,919,1113_aID1AD.txt,they can do better things in that age like playing games outside.
920,920,1113_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand you can say that they have to decide for themeselve.
921,921,1113_aID1AD.txt,but arent they too young for that?
922,922,1113_aID1AD.txt,i havent watched tv in that young age and i think that it is not an disadvantage for me.
923,923,1113_aID1AD.txt,i see more advanteges by not watching television.
924,924,1113_aID1AD.txt,my parents took that decision for me and they knew what was good for me at that time.
925,925,1113_aID1AD.txt,the most things you cann see on tv at are things you can discover for your self.
926,926,1113_aID1AD.txt,you could collect your own experiances.
927,927,1113_aID1AD.txt,but you can not see that in general.
928,928,1113_aID1AD.txt,if you take other familiys you would find other oppinions.
929,929,1113_aID1AD.txt,perherps some familys would think itâ´s good.
930,930,1113_aID1AD.txt,they could argue with the creativly of the kids.
931,931,1113_aID1AD.txt,tv could make theme more creatively.
932,932,1113_aID1AD.txt,so they could have an bigger horizion.
933,933,1113_aID1AD.txt,all in all it could have two sides of view.
934,934,1113_aID1AD.txt,in my oppinion it is not good for young children to watch television advertising directed toward young children.
935,935,1114_aID1AD.txt,i would understand if someone says that there is no differance between advertation and manipulation.
936,936,1114_aID1AD.txt,"but it is not that easy, you need to check many other factors which influents opinions."
937,937,1114_aID1AD.txt,one stong arguement againt advertising towards young children is that they don't realise this manipulation.
938,938,1114_aID1AD.txt,"if they watching theese ads theyre just like ""oh mama i want this""."
939,939,1114_aID1AD.txt,they dont think about specific stategies which companys could use to make the people buy their products.
940,940,1114_aID1AD.txt,another opinion could be that the eventually decision is made by the parents.
941,941,1114_aID1AD.txt,but there may be parents do everything for their children.
942,942,1114_aID1AD.txt,but in my opinion thats part of our economic system.
943,943,1114_aID1AD.txt,everbody need comercial at least someone who has an company.
944,944,1114_aID1AD.txt,whitout advertation its very difficult to get new customers.
945,945,1114_aID1AD.txt,but there is not just the company lead ads.
946,946,1114_aID1AD.txt,there is oral propaganda too.
947,947,1115_aID1AD.txt,i think it's okay if children want to watch television.
948,948,1115_aID1AD.txt,but it's also important to think about the consequences.
949,949,1115_aID1AD.txt,when i was in the age (two to five) i've loved to watch it but i think the main reason was that my parents didn't allowed me to watch it.
950,950,1115_aID1AD.txt,me and my siblings were allowed to watch from 7.00 pm to 7.50 pm.
951,951,1115_aID1AD.txt,it was a tradition and everyone looked forward to these fifty minutes.
952,952,1115_aID1AD.txt,all in all i'd say it's okay if children are allowed to watch tv.
953,953,1115_aID1AD.txt,but it's also important to think about what could happen if they watch too much.
954,954,1115_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion it's not that intelligent to let kids watch tv the whole time.
955,955,1115_aID1AD.txt,i know that children have to play outside and do things without any technology.
956,956,1115_aID1AD.txt,i'm from the generation where the media got important.
957,957,1115_aID1AD.txt,i'm lucky that i had a childhood without a phone or a computer - all these things were something my parents didn't allowed me to play with.
958,958,1115_aID1AD.txt,i remember the happiness i've felt when my father gave me his phone for a minute or when my parents said that i can watch a movie that's longer than forty-five minutes.
959,959,1115_aID1AD.txt,in fact i'm lucky that i wasn't in the gerneration where phones and other technologies took over.
960,960,1115_aID1AD.txt,"now, when i see all these five-graders with a cellphone bigger than their heads, i'm happy my parents forced me to play outside."
961,961,1115_aID1AD.txt,back to the question - i think there are positive things if parents let their kids sit in front of the tv but they have to watch over them.
962,962,1115_aID1AD.txt,one hour is totally fine for young-aged children.
963,963,1115_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion parents have to - especially nowadays - be stricter with children or young teenager.
964,964,1115_aID1AD.txt,you can see what phones and computer did to them.
965,965,1115_aID1AD.txt,"the only thing they care about is what their new profile picture should look like or why they have not that much ""likes"" at their instagram-picture."
966,966,1115_aID1AD.txt,it all started with the television because it's the first technological thing young children can work with.
967,967,1115_aID1AD.txt,if parents don't watch over them they don't stop watching the tv.
968,968,1115_aID1AD.txt,"and, in my opinion, that's not far away from using a mobile everytime."
969,969,1115_aID1AD.txt,all in all in think it should be allowed for young-aged children to watch tv but parents have to take look if it's not too long or what movie is on the tv.
970,970,1115_aID1AD.txt,that's another point: many parents don't care about what their child actually watch.
971,971,1115_aID1AD.txt,it could be a documentation but also a movie that's not allowed for children under eighteen.
972,972,1115_aID1AD.txt,so my opinion is that tv is okay.
973,973,1115_aID1AD.txt,"me and my family always enjoyed it and i want this for other families, too."
974,974,1115_aID1AD.txt,but there has to be a limit.
975,975,1115_aID1AD.txt,"if parents know what's good for there children, they can say how long they're allowed to watch."
976,976,1115_aID1AD.txt,i'm sure that parents who know the consequences are able to say when their children have to stop watching tv.
977,977,1115_aID1AD.txt,"if parents are trusting and caring with the fact that their kids use a technological product and a thing that can make ""abhã¤ngig""(?"
978,978,1115_aID1AD.txt,but it's important that - especially today - someone watches more over the technological use from children.
979,979,1116_aID1AD.txt,television advertisement is nowadays used to get the consumer's attention and to attract them to buy a company's products.
980,980,1116_aID1AD.txt,"therefore, firms use the most abstract way to potray their product publicly."
981,981,1116_aID1AD.txt,children watching these advertisements are often influenced by the product's appearance in the media.
982,982,1116_aID1AD.txt,the consumption should be determined by the quality of a product rather than the appearance.
983,983,1116_aID1AD.txt,"of course, firms like toysrus have to adapt their advertising to the group they want to target to get the best possible outcome."
984,984,1116_aID1AD.txt,"but considering that today society is dependent on media more than ever, the influence ads have on both children and adults is increasingly high."
985,985,1116_aID1AD.txt,especially kids should not be raised in such a materialized society.
986,986,1116_aID1AD.txt,they cannot differ between the appearance of the product in the advertisement and the realistic relation between price and quality.
987,987,1116_aID1AD.txt,that will lead parents to buying products they would consider too expensive or not appropriate under usual circumstances.
988,988,1116_aID1AD.txt,"why should a three-year-old girl want anything else than the new robot-barbie, that is praised to be the one and only toy in advertisements?"
989,989,1116_aID1AD.txt,these advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only: they're supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it.
990,990,1116_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion, parents should keep their children away from tv-advertisements as long as they cannot differ between real quality and the quality the products are promised to have."
991,991,1116_aID1AD.txt,"otherwise, advertising will overcome rational consumption."
992,992,1119_aID1AD.txt,the topic of advertising in the tv to young children is difficult.
993,993,1119_aID1AD.txt,"children shouldnâ´t watch tv often in that age, thatâ´s clearly."
994,994,1119_aID1AD.txt,"for the concerns itâ´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it, they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it."
995,995,1119_aID1AD.txt,but itâ´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit.
996,996,1119_aID1AD.txt,maybe it isnâ´t wrong to start in a young age with that things.
997,997,1119_aID1AD.txt,so the children may know what will happend in an older age.
998,998,1119_aID1AD.txt,"everyone is controlled by the media, at all in the digitalized (like tv or radio) and in the undigitalized way (like newspaper)."
999,999,1119_aID1AD.txt,finally i agree with the statement.
1000,1000,1119_aID1AD.txt,i think that shouldnâ´t be allowed because the children have to play outside with friends or get wet from the rain without any problem.
1001,1001,1119_aID1AD.txt,they should not controle by the media so early.
1002,1002,1128_aID1AD.txt,"the statement, that televisions should not be allowed to young children between two and five years is sometimes correct."
1003,1003,1128_aID1AD.txt,children in these years are in an important part of  their life.
1004,1004,1128_aID1AD.txt,for example to learn the first things for school.
1005,1005,1128_aID1AD.txt,some kind of them have to find new friends when they begin the time in the kindergarden.
1006,1006,1128_aID1AD.txt,now it`s important to concentrate to get a correct circle of people.
1007,1007,1128_aID1AD.txt,"in this chapter of their life, they normally have to play outside with friends and don`t have to sit in their room and watch tv."
1008,1008,1128_aID1AD.txt,"it`s bad, that they maybe see things they souldn`t have to see maybe some scenes of terror or something like that.they don`t understand it and they get fear."
1009,1009,1128_aID1AD.txt,"itâ´s important, when the children have to watch tv, to choose the right program."
1010,1010,1128_aID1AD.txt,"a good point is, that some kind of them show news for children, so they can understand it, or show some series with animals."
1011,1011,1128_aID1AD.txt,"i think itâ´s important to draw a line between playing outside, doing homeworks and watching tv."
1012,1012,1128_aID1AD.txt,"i share the opinion that children in this chapter of their life, have to play outside."
1013,1013,1128_aID1AD.txt,"after the kindergarden or school, if they finished their homeworks or other things which they have to do, it`s okay to watch tv in a cutted time."
1014,1014,1128_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion it`s sad how much children in this chapter, become bad in school or can`t speek very well, because they only watch tv."
1015,1015,1128_aID1AD.txt,"all in one i think it`s okay, that children watch tv in a small part of time, if they don`t forget to do important things for school and playing outside with their friends."
1016,1016,1130_aID1AD.txt,"the following text is an essay about the statement ""television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.""."
1017,1017,1130_aID1AD.txt,"on the positive side of advertising stands the fact that companies make a lot money from the parents which got affected by their children to buy them their toys, candy, and so on."
1018,1018,1130_aID1AD.txt,"tv channels also make a lot money with advertising too, which is also a good thing."
1019,1019,1130_aID1AD.txt,in the end advertising directed to children is a big and important part of the economy.
1020,1020,1130_aID1AD.txt,on the negative side stands that young children between the age of two and five are easily affected by what they see in tv.
1021,1021,1130_aID1AD.txt,"so they want almost everything they see, and they get it, because theyâ´ll bag for it until they get what they want."
1022,1022,1130_aID1AD.txt,"in the first time that does not sound really bad in any way, but if you really think about it, it is."
1023,1023,1130_aID1AD.txt,because the first years of a humans life are probably the most important ones.
1024,1024,1130_aID1AD.txt,"we learn the most in this years, and if we get anything we want, if our parents always buy our favourite candy at the groucery; we learn that it is normal to get anything we want, and that it is normal to always get and eat our favourite candy."
1025,1025,1130_aID1AD.txt,"out of this facts are resulting a lot of problems, like people which think they always get what they want."
1026,1026,1130_aID1AD.txt,"and people which instinctively think it is okay to eat a lot of bad food, and then getting really obese and fat."
1027,1027,1130_aID1AD.txt,all in all i donâ´t really agree or disagree with the statement.
1028,1028,1130_aID1AD.txt,"i think comercials for children should be limited, and controlled."
1029,1029,1130_aID1AD.txt,"and that in a way that they wonâ´t get affected by them in the wrong way, but still learn how to handle them; because they will always face comercials in their lifes."
1030,1030,1131_aID1AD.txt,"children at a young age are a great audience for big buisneses, who want to sell their stuff."
1031,1031,1131_aID1AD.txt,"but as always there are some disadvantages and some advantages, for the children, their parents and those buisneses."
1032,1032,1131_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television.
1033,1033,1131_aID1AD.txt,they got easily distracted by it and they also got influenced by the advertising in television.
1034,1034,1131_aID1AD.txt,little children can't understand that the toys or sweets that are shown are rarely the way as we see them in tv.
1035,1035,1131_aID1AD.txt,"they start asking their parents, if they may have all this too expensive things."
1036,1036,1131_aID1AD.txt,"often the parents won't allow them buying those things, but when children get confronted with this ""cool stuff"" their friends in kindergarten may have, they get sad and won't be part of the group."
1037,1037,1131_aID1AD.txt,"buisneses are spending a lot of money on advertisings in general and they know exactly in which way they can reach everybody, from small children to old people."
1038,1038,1131_aID1AD.txt,"for their younger audience, they use bright and shiny colours and cool effects."
1039,1039,1131_aID1AD.txt,"they often know, in which way they may influence the parents of the children too, they make them believe, that those things are good for their children."
1040,1040,1131_aID1AD.txt,"at least, i agree with the statement, advertising should be used on older peolpe, but not on kids at this young age."
1041,1041,1131_aID1AD.txt,"children shouldn't get to know the way, money, beauty and  expensiv stuff in general influence everyone of us and how they affect our daily life."
1042,1042,1132_aID1AD.txt,"in the following text i will find arguments for and against the statement ""television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed""."
1043,1043,1132_aID1AD.txt,a point for con side is that parents could find out what there children like and dislike playing with.
1044,1044,1132_aID1AD.txt,they could look at the reaction of ther children.
1045,1045,1132_aID1AD.txt,an angurment that it should not be allowed is that the children like the television advertising so much that they dont want to leave the television and look way to much of it.
1046,1046,1132_aID1AD.txt,"my next point against that statement is that children could enjoy the advertising between ther series, they dont have to upset when ther serie is ending because ther is an advertising adressing them and not just ther parents."
1047,1047,1132_aID1AD.txt,another point for the stament is that children could like every spot so much that they want everything what they see and so the parents have to tell the children why it isnt possible to buy them all what they want to have.
1048,1048,1132_aID1AD.txt,"the most important point against the statement is that the children could enjoy what they are seeing, they could even have fun during the advertising."
1049,1049,1132_aID1AD.txt,"the most important point for this statement is that the children should not sit in front of the television all the time, they should go and play outside on a playground whit ther parents or ther friends."
1050,1050,1132_aID1AD.txt,"so if they like the advertising to much they could forget playing outside and when the children are young you could bring them much more easier on your side, so that they do whatever you want."
1051,1051,1132_aID1AD.txt,"i totally agree to this statement, because it could bring the young children to much to the television and could them let forget to play outside."
1052,1052,1132_aID1AD.txt,"its much more important that young children learn something in books or outside then watching television advertising just made for them and in the young age its easier to get in that children mind and to let them think what they should think about ther product, so that they want to buy it or the parents should buy it and when they dont buy it the young children are sad."
1053,1053,1132_aID1AD.txt,and two to five years is way to early to watch much televisison and television advertising.
1054,1054,1133_aID1AD.txt,today children are already confronted with the permanet influence of social media and technology at a very young age which seems to be a chance for companies to sell their products by using advertising in a clever way.
1055,1055,1133_aID1AD.txt,"that's why i'm going to discuss the following statement: ""television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."""
1056,1056,1133_aID1AD.txt,on the one hand there are arguments against such a law.
1057,1057,1133_aID1AD.txt,for exemple one can say that permanent advertising is a part of our time today so that children have to learn how to handle it.
1058,1058,1133_aID1AD.txt,also adults and teenagers are always confronted with advertisemen - for example last week i saw a new car in the tv but i wasn't able to buy it because of a lack of money.
1059,1059,1133_aID1AD.txt,furthermore getting to know many toys they would like to have by television advertisings could help little children to accept that they won't get everything they wish in their life and that they have to be happy with what they get.
1060,1060,1133_aID1AD.txt,but on the other hand there are also arguments for television advertising toward young children not to be allowed.
1061,1061,1133_aID1AD.txt,a law against it could be understood as resistance against the money-ruled society we have got today.
1062,1062,1133_aID1AD.txt,"critics say that children have to be protected from this ""bad world"" to enjoy their childhood and develope in the best way."
1063,1063,1133_aID1AD.txt,they will become an adult fastly enough.
1064,1064,1133_aID1AD.txt,for example its seems to me as if my childhood has just ended and now i'm already confonted with the force of earning money next year - after leaving school - to become independent and live the life i want.
1065,1065,1133_aID1AD.txt,in addition parents might be happy about tv programm without advertising directed toward young children because they wouldn't suffer from an annoying child who really wants to have the toy car it has just seen in tv and cries now the whole time because his parents won't buy the mentioned car.
1066,1066,1133_aID1AD.txt,especially because of the two last arguments i'm agains television advertisement for children.
1067,1067,1151_aID1AD.txt,there are a few different reasons why television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
1068,1068,1151_aID1AD.txt,"first of all, young children aged two to five aren't able to recognize if it's true or not what they are told and what they see on television.on television advertising, there are used many tricks that make the people believe they will be happier and their life will be much better with the product that is shown."
1069,1069,1151_aID1AD.txt,"the children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life, because they do not have any experiences like that yet."
1070,1070,1151_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand, they can maybe also learn something within watching television advertising."
1071,1071,1151_aID1AD.txt,"even on such a young age they can also make their own experiences with consum.it could be a way for them to experience that advertising is not always the truth.in my opinion it would be good, if children learn the difference between what they are told as a (zielperson) ,and what things are realy like,on a young age."
1072,1072,1151_aID1AD.txt,"it would be important to take care, that the children are not confronted with advertising too often."
1073,1073,1151_aID1AD.txt,otherwise it could have a negative influence on they
1074,1074,1152_aID1AD.txt,when it comes to young children parents tend to protect them from outer influences as long as possible.
1075,1075,1152_aID1AD.txt,"on the one hand you could say parents are overprotective, children must learn about the actual reality and have to deal with the triggers people send with advertisements."
1076,1076,1152_aID1AD.txt,parents themselves often cannot recognize the triggers in advertisements and watch them daily without fearing an influence by media.
1077,1077,1152_aID1AD.txt,so you can question why there would be a potential bad influence for their children.
1078,1078,1152_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand the young children's brain must firstly learn when truths and when lies are told before they can be confronted with advertisements which influence children's thoughts.
1079,1079,1152_aID1AD.txt,television advertisements manipulate the brain by sending out triggers often not recognized by the mentality.
1080,1080,1152_aID1AD.txt,children cannot tell if people tell the truth or a lie at such a young age.
1081,1081,1152_aID1AD.txt,"to not leave children with this manipulation is not overprotective it is good parenting, which protects young children from problematic influences until they can do it themselves, so i agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, but only until they do can tell truths from lies or triggers, they cannot be cut of reality because of potential influences for their whole life."
1082,1082,1153_aID1AD.txt,there are several reasons why television advertising toward young children should or should not be allowed.
1083,1083,1153_aID1AD.txt,i think that children in the age of two to five are too young to understand that they are manipulated by the commercials.
1084,1084,1153_aID1AD.txt,"they will believe everything they are told and by that are easy to manipulate, so that they want to buy all the products the commercial is showing."
1085,1085,1153_aID1AD.txt,"children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them."
1086,1086,1153_aID1AD.txt,that's why televison advertisement that's directed toward young children causes trouble.
1087,1087,1153_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand it's good for the economy if many things are sold, but i think, that children don't understand the advertisement and just want to have the newest best toy and in the advertisement every toy is shown like it's the best of them all."
1088,1088,1153_aID1AD.txt,that's why it's unfair to show children these commercials.
1089,1089,1153_aID1AD.txt,"the advertisement could also show the children the variety of items and make them understand, that they don't need everything that's shown in the commercials, but i think that they are just too young to judge."
1090,1090,1154_aID1AD.txt,"
advertises are often shown in the tv."
1091,1091,1154_aID1AD.txt,they adress all ages even really young children.
1092,1092,1154_aID1AD.txt,and that might be a problem as many criticers say.
1093,1093,1154_aID1AD.txt,young children are easily influencable by television advertising.
1094,1094,1154_aID1AD.txt,so they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour.
1095,1095,1154_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand we could say that it is part of the parentâ´s job to decide if and what their children watch in the tv, to give them the right values."
1096,1096,1154_aID1AD.txt,another point might be that children aged two to five are not interested in advertises and even if they are they have no opportunity to get what they want without their parents.
1097,1097,1154_aID1AD.txt,so the parents can control their children nevertheless.
1098,1098,1154_aID1AD.txt,and every child has to learn that not everything what is said in the tv is good and that they can not get anything what they want.
1099,1099,1154_aID1AD.txt,this is a really important process in the life of a child and the understanding is easier when it starts as early as possible.
1100,1100,1154_aID1AD.txt,so i would say that television advertising toward young children should not be forbidden but the parents might know that they have to control the tv activity of their children.
1101,1101,1155_aID1AD.txt,television is in our time an important source for news for adults or teenagers.
1102,1102,1155_aID1AD.txt,but also young children use it for education.
1103,1103,1155_aID1AD.txt,there are many movies or series with an educating backround.
1104,1104,1155_aID1AD.txt,but the question is if it is so good that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five years) and if it should not be allowed?
1105,1105,1155_aID1AD.txt,in the following part i will explain and answer these questions.
1106,1106,1155_aID1AD.txt,firstly children get influence by television.
1107,1107,1155_aID1AD.txt,and specially young children who arent educated or who start to learn are a part of these.
1108,1108,1155_aID1AD.txt,children aged two to five years start to speak and to create their own personality.
1109,1109,1155_aID1AD.txt,"so that there are also bad influences, what have follows for the future life of these children."
1110,1110,1155_aID1AD.txt,"for example if young children watch 'teletubbies', who aren't speaking with words the hole episodes, they maybe also wouldn't speak."
1111,1111,1155_aID1AD.txt,this discussion about the 'teletubbies' are public in the world and politiciens think about stopping the production and to stop selling the dvds.
1112,1112,1155_aID1AD.txt,but an important thing is also that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life.
1113,1113,1155_aID1AD.txt,they can learn about the right and the wrong.
1114,1114,1155_aID1AD.txt,what is easier to understand when you watch it.
1115,1115,1155_aID1AD.txt,how to handle with another children or how to prepare for school.
1116,1116,1155_aID1AD.txt,so that television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life.
1117,1117,1155_aID1AD.txt,"so i'm disagree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."
1118,1118,1155_aID1AD.txt,television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.
1119,1119,1155_aID1AD.txt,these are a too important education source for them.
1120,1120,1155_aID1AD.txt,"there are more positiv follows for young children, who watch tv than negative ones."
1121,1121,1157_aID1AD.txt,in the last five years more children in the age of two to five started watching televion for more than three hours a day.
1122,1122,1157_aID1AD.txt,the reason for that is that the television advertise directly toward young children.
1123,1123,1157_aID1AD.txt,on one site children can learn from some of these chanels for young people.
1124,1124,1157_aID1AD.txt,many chanels started producing movies and series for young children where they show how to learn for example languages like english or french.
1125,1125,1157_aID1AD.txt,"as a consequence of this children already learn even in a young age how to speak an other language, so they will may be better when they will come to school and started learning this language there."
1126,1126,1157_aID1AD.txt,"on the other site if children started watching television in their freetime for more than one to two hours a day, they have no time to do other things, like going outsite and playing with friends."
1127,1127,1157_aID1AD.txt,but in the age of two to five it is very important to have social contact to other people in their age.
1128,1128,1157_aID1AD.txt,"so in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children in the age of two to five should not be allowed, because in this age children started making their first social contacts, which is very impotant for their growing up."
1129,1129,1157_aID1AD.txt,"but if the children are just sitting in front of their television they have no time to make these contacts, so it could be that they later may have problems making friends with other people."
1130,1130,1158_aID1AD.txt,all of the younger generations are often seen as the generation of the internet and social media.
1131,1131,1158_aID1AD.txt,but many children nowadays also watch more television instead of playing with their friends.
1132,1132,1158_aID1AD.txt,"in fact, more and more parents ""plant"" their kids in front of the television to have some rest or because the child is more calm."
1133,1133,1158_aID1AD.txt,"this effect is often used by huge companies, directing their advertisements towards younger children, in order to raise their sales figures."
1134,1134,1158_aID1AD.txt,"this can be seen as exploiting the children's innocence, since they tend to wish for things they saw and that excited them."
1135,1135,1158_aID1AD.txt,"the companies actually manipulate the children because especially the younger ones, aged two to five, can't decide whether it is something they really need or if it was simply shown in an advertisement."
1136,1136,1158_aID1AD.txt,"so should, as a consequence, this advertising be forbidden?"
1137,1137,1158_aID1AD.txt,"personally, i don't consider this solution as efficient or neccessary, even if children are nothing but the medium to their parents' money."
1138,1138,1158_aID1AD.txt,"enterprises have chosen this method of advertising because they are on current with nowadays' methods of ""raising"" a child and that televisions are often a part of it."
1139,1139,1158_aID1AD.txt,"if the parents now think of this advertising as ethically wrong, one also has to think about who is letting two to five year olds sit in front of the tv."
1140,1140,1158_aID1AD.txt,so it is actually the parents' duty to raise their kinds sensible to what they are seeing or hearing.
1141,1141,1158_aID1AD.txt,"for sure, children are manipulated by exciting advertisements and are used to make their parents buy these products, but if parents are upset with that, they shouldn't allow their child to be manipulated."
1142,1142,1158_aID1AD.txt,"instead of blaming companies of their poor skills raising their child, they should put more attention to what they are transmitting their child and enlighten them about possible manipulating advertising, even at that young age."
1143,1143,1158_aID1AD.txt,letting a two year old sit in front of the television is not the right way to silent them and there are a lot of other methods to use in order to excite one's child.
1144,1144,1158_aID1AD.txt,"so, play with your kids instead of telling media to stop such advertising."
1145,1145,1158_aID1AD.txt,"you don't need to worry about something, that has no impact on you or your children."
1146,1146,1159_aID1AD.txt,i'm agree with the following statement that television advertising directed toward young children in the age between two to five should not be allowed.
1147,1147,1159_aID1AD.txt,"in this case you have to know that television advertising can be negative for the growing up of little children because in many television advertising, there are bad stuff."
1148,1148,1159_aID1AD.txt,it's right that little children in the age between two to five don't understand much about a lot of things but i think that the television advertising would influence them indirect in their growing up.
1149,1149,1159_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand, i think it's alright if there is television advertising especially for their age group but if there's television advertising for teenager/adults it's not okay anymore."
1150,1150,1159_aID1AD.txt,television or any other media stuff is a big factor and influence in our world for all people.
1151,1151,1159_aID1AD.txt,you have to think how little children feel aswell but not many persons do that.
1152,1152,1159_aID1AD.txt,"they only think ""they are small, they don't think, they understand nothing in their age"" and for them it doesn't matter how they feel."
1153,1153,1159_aID1AD.txt,"but you have to see it in a different view, little children maybe know what's going on in this situation and television advertising is sometimes, not always, a part of their growing up."
1154,1154,1159_aID1AD.txt,"maybe they don't understand a lot but they know, or better to say they feel all of that what's happened."
1155,1155,1159_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion the worse thing and you can't do it aswell is that nobody asks them how they feel or if they want that.
1156,1156,1159_aID1AD.txt,all people think of themselves and this is in character very egoistic/selfish.
1157,1157,1159_aID1AD.txt,"in conclusion, you see sometimes it is important that television advertising directed toward little children in some cases (if it's not television advertising for adults/teenagers) but summarized it should not be allowed."
1158,1158,1160_aID1AD.txt,nowerdays childreen spend lots of their time watching television.
1159,1159,1160_aID1AD.txt,"as many smaller childreen (aged two to five) believe in evrerthing they hear or see because they are not able to bild their own opinion yet, they are a popular victim of advertising companies."
1160,1160,1160_aID1AD.txt,"there are ads for toys, kids food and the newest sport articles."
1161,1161,1160_aID1AD.txt,the ads are often  straight directed towards young childreen with the use of childish language and by creating a happy and concsious atmospere with backround music and certain matching colors in the spot.
1162,1162,1160_aID1AD.txt,"it leads to different behavior of your childreen, as they want more and more because they get to see the newest and hottest toys erveryday, that is why soner or later nothing will be good enough for them anymore."
1163,1163,1160_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand your kids are always well informed about the newest trends.
1164,1164,1160_aID1AD.txt,therefore it is possibly the best way to find a way between getting your childreen some of the goods but not always and when ever they want.
1165,1165,1160_aID1AD.txt,but advertisement also creates a wrong image of reality.
1166,1166,1160_aID1AD.txt,articles shown in ads compared to their real quality and outer aperience often contains a big differnece.
1167,1167,1160_aID1AD.txt,"in the ads everything looks perfect, ervery girl or boy is smiling and ervery product is shining as the products are are made looking perfect for the ads with the help of modern computer technology like photoshop."
1168,1168,1160_aID1AD.txt,"that's why i think there should be certain rules for the advertising companies which they have to follow, for example to downgradse the use of photoshop to influence the childreen."
1169,1169,1160_aID1AD.txt,because they bring parents into difficult situations where it is hard for them not to upset their childreen when they see the actuall product compared to the image which was presented in the ads before.
1170,1170,1161_aID1AD.txt,my opinion to that statement is divided.
1171,1171,1161_aID1AD.txt,"on the one hand i think that the television advertising which is directed toward young children could lead to a higher television consume at a younger age, because the young children are willing to watch the advertising which is meant especially for them."
1172,1172,1161_aID1AD.txt,"in this case, they would spend more time inside the house and not in the nature playing with their friends."
1173,1173,1161_aID1AD.txt,the parents have to keep an eye on their children to protect them against too much television advertising and television consume.
1174,1174,1161_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand i think that it is not that necessary to not allow television advertising directed toward young children, because it is in the hand of the parents or everyone else in general how to handle this situation."
1175,1175,1161_aID1AD.txt,in our modern times and the technical improvements it is clear that companies search for ways to improve their advertising aswell.
1176,1176,1161_aID1AD.txt,that is why they use the televison to spread their advertising for their products all over the country on the easy way with putting it into the televison.
1177,1177,1161_aID1AD.txt,"in my opinion the companies hope to reach with that kind of advertising, with cute little children in it, the parents and make them buy that product for their child too or to buy it just because that advertising make them feel in some way."
1178,1178,1161_aID1AD.txt,"i think parents identify easily with televison advertising which is set up like this, because they think about their own child directly."
1179,1179,1161_aID1AD.txt,but i think everybody have to think about that statement on his own to have an own opinion about it.
1180,1180,1161_aID1AD.txt,"i can not make a point in that case, because i can understand the companies acting in that way, but i can also think of the fears people might have about television advertising directed toward young children."
1181,1181,1161_aID1AD.txt,"all in all it is a exercise for all of us to find a good way to handle this situation, because the technology will improve and improve and there will be more and more companies using this way of advertising."
1182,1182,1162_aID1AD.txt,"first of all, i would say that it would be difficult to stop televison advertising which is directed toward young children in the ages from two to five."
1183,1183,1162_aID1AD.txt,televison advertising could be helpful especialy for parents if they donâ´t have an idea concerning to give a present to their child.
1184,1184,1162_aID1AD.txt,"but on the other hand, watching telivison advertising in these ages can lead to the missing ability to appreciate things which are advertised in the tv, such as toys or electronic devises to play with."
1185,1185,1162_aID1AD.txt,"if they always want more toys, the parents maybe will follow their wishes to make their children happy and make these wishes come true, which can lead to the missing abilities mentioned before."
1186,1186,1162_aID1AD.txt,they also wouldnâ´t know the value of these things.
1187,1187,1162_aID1AD.txt,"my opinion to this topic is, that televsion  advertising directed to young children should be stopped."
1188,1188,1162_aID1AD.txt,"furthermore, the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch tv."
1189,1189,1162_aID1AD.txt,"watching tv in these ages can also be discussed, whether itâ´s good for them."
1190,1190,1164_aID1AD.txt,nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches tv.
1191,1191,1164_aID1AD.txt,in the television is so much aadvertising like never before and even small children watch television.
1192,1192,1164_aID1AD.txt,so it may occure the question whether tv advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) shoud or should not be allowed.
1193,1193,1164_aID1AD.txt,first you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children.
1194,1194,1164_aID1AD.txt,so the little child can watch tv and after the adverts it says that it likes to have this and that.
1195,1195,1164_aID1AD.txt,"therefor the child doesn't have to speak well, it's enough to say ""i want that"" and it points on the advert."
1196,1196,1164_aID1AD.txt,"then, the parents can simply buy the object."
1197,1197,1164_aID1AD.txt,"next, this kind of advertising helps the companies to improve their sales and adress the specific group of people which the products are made for."
1198,1198,1164_aID1AD.txt,so they would do baby-toy-advertisments only for young children aged from two to five.
1199,1199,1164_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand, this adverts shouldn't be allowe because these young children can't do anything with this adverts."
1200,1200,1164_aID1AD.txt,the children get irritated and don't know how to react.
1201,1201,1164_aID1AD.txt,as an adolscent you know how to deal with adverts and that their content isn't always the truth.
1202,1202,1164_aID1AD.txt,but children especially young children don't know.
1203,1203,1164_aID1AD.txt,"more important, theses adverts influence the children's mind and their psychological development."
1204,1204,1164_aID1AD.txt,children may believe what's said in the advert.
1205,1205,1164_aID1AD.txt,plus the strategy of advertisment is to create needs and children can't deal with that.
1206,1206,1164_aID1AD.txt,"all in all, adverts for children aged from two to five shouldn't be allowed because of their negative effects on the children."
1207,1207,1164_aID1AD.txt,they create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development.
1208,1208,1164_aID1AD.txt,they only help companies to improve their profits and this is not good.
1209,1209,1165_aID1AD.txt,in the following text i will inform you about television advertising.
1210,1210,1165_aID1AD.txt,i am agree with this statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects.
1211,1211,1165_aID1AD.txt,the first one is that the children often want the object in the televion.
1212,1212,1165_aID1AD.txt,they think that is cool and they often try to convince their parents.
1213,1213,1165_aID1AD.txt,"if they don't get the object, they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents."
1214,1214,1165_aID1AD.txt,the parents don't like to see their children cry and they bought the object for them.
1215,1215,1165_aID1AD.txt,forthermore the childrens often dont need the object.
1216,1216,1165_aID1AD.txt,the seller push their object in the advertising because he know what he have to say.
1217,1217,1165_aID1AD.txt,he only tells the posi and the children see that and in result they get it from their parents.
1218,1218,1165_aID1AD.txt,in addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising.
1219,1219,1165_aID1AD.txt,the children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money.
1220,1220,1165_aID1AD.txt,"if they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life."
1221,1221,1165_aID1AD.txt,all in all the advertising isn't good for the young people.
1222,1222,1165_aID1AD.txt,it stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends.
1223,1223,1166_aID1AD.txt,''television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed``.
1224,1224,1166_aID1AD.txt,thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young children.i dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them.
1225,1225,1166_aID1AD.txt,every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child.
1226,1226,1166_aID1AD.txt,not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children for example aged two to five understand the things they see.many parents cant even imagine that many aspects while the growing process can have an influence on the futured personality of the kids.for me its the biggest problem in todays community and forbiding of television andvertising directed to to the young children wouldnt be a solution for the probmlem.
1227,1227,1166_aID1AD.txt,for me its hard to judge about this because i never thought so intensiv about this topic.
1228,1228,1166_aID1AD.txt,maybe because i am not a parent yet so its hard for me to find more arguments for and against the statement manchend at the begiining.
1229,1229,1167_aID1AD.txt,"in the following text, i will discuss the controverse theme if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not."
1230,1230,1167_aID1AD.txt,"on one hand itâ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children, because the children in the age of two to five canâ´t say anything about there own opinion, because they are to young to say it."
1231,1231,1167_aID1AD.txt,i think children maybe donâ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.
1232,1232,1167_aID1AD.txt,the children aged two to five are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being directed toward them.
1233,1233,1167_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand you could say that itâ´s good to direct the advertising toward young children even if they canâ´t say if they want to do that, because itâ´s the only way to direct an advertising toward young children."
1234,1234,1167_aID1AD.txt,itâ´s also important for the television advertising to do that.
1235,1235,1167_aID1AD.txt,all in all i think the statement is correct even though it might be important for the television to direct advertising toward those young children.
1236,1236,1169_aID1AD.txt,"""young children should play outside more often"" that is sentence every child has heard a lot of times in her or his young years, but why should they play outside?"
1237,1237,1169_aID1AD.txt,now a days a television and the outraging development of the technology is very normal to the young generation and there parent generation.
1238,1238,1169_aID1AD.txt,the only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all.
1239,1239,1169_aID1AD.txt,there are a few ones that do not have a probleme with the change but the most do.
1240,1240,1169_aID1AD.txt,so the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation.
1241,1241,1169_aID1AD.txt,the children should be allowed to watch television and use all the technology the presnt has to offer because we are living in a constant development of technology and in the future there will be more of that.
1242,1242,1169_aID1AD.txt,some say that it is all going to be compromized and going to be technical.
1243,1243,1169_aID1AD.txt,the only thing parents could do is to set a limit of tv watching for there children so they can be social and hang out with there friends.
1244,1244,1169_aID1AD.txt,actually that is a thing that every child is going to do in that young age they are going to the kindergarden or to a kita and will only be watching tv in the mo0ments when they are at home.
1245,1245,1169_aID1AD.txt,as you can see there are a lot of times where they do not have time watch tv so they shopuld have a time where they are allowed to watch there series or there favorite movie.
1246,1246,1169_aID1AD.txt,that is what makes the children happy now a days.
1247,1247,1169_aID1AD.txt,furthermore more many child series and movies on tv teach many life lessons so that the children will be prepared for life and their social life.
1248,1248,1169_aID1AD.txt,"for example dora or other series there are some episodes where they solve math problemes, teach you how to deal with strangers or hoe to treat your friends."
1249,1249,1169_aID1AD.txt,fact is that the series that they watch on tv prepare for school.
1250,1250,1169_aID1AD.txt,the only thing that could be held against that statement is that there are not only children series on tv but also horror movies and other bad stuff that children at that age should not watch.
1251,1251,1169_aID1AD.txt,for that parents can just install a code for those channels so the children will not have a chance to watch these.
1252,1252,1169_aID1AD.txt,"also to hold against the argument that children that watch tv are not interfering with there family anymore, the parents could watch the sereies with them and make a game out of it so they will make tv watching a family activity."
1253,1253,1169_aID1AD.txt,in the end i can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that.
1254,1254,1169_aID1AD.txt,in the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life.
1255,1255,1171_aID1AD.txt,"in the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement "" television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed""."
1256,1256,1171_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples.
1257,1257,1171_aID1AD.txt,the first reason is that young children at the age from two to five can not understand the main statement from the television because there brain can not translate or understand the film which is shown as a consequence it should not be allowed.
1258,1258,1171_aID1AD.txt,my second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives.
1259,1259,1171_aID1AD.txt,the third and important reason for me is that the television is a media which is lying fluently to have better quotes of the public to become famous and rich.
1260,1260,1171_aID1AD.txt,the children would grow up with wrong information before they could understand the truth of the television and its consequences on their.
1261,1261,1171_aID1AD.txt,there future lives could be mainly destroyed or would stay on the lies of the television.
1262,1262,1171_aID1AD.txt,my last reason is that children at the age of two to five are defintiv to young to look tv because of the risks and the consequences of this media to themselves.
1263,1263,1177_aID1AD.txt,"this essay will be about the ban of advertising spots on television, directing to children between the age of two and five."
1264,1264,1177_aID1AD.txt,"on the one hand, children are not able to think critically about the advertisement."
1265,1265,1177_aID1AD.txt,they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant.
1266,1266,1177_aID1AD.txt,"for example, children do not need their own playstation when they are really young, they do not know that it is unhealthy if they use it too much, for example, that they get problems with their eyes et cetera."
1267,1267,1177_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand, if the parents take care of them and pay attention, the children will not get any problems, but they will have fun with their new toy or other things."
1268,1268,1177_aID1AD.txt,"but children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy."
1269,1269,1177_aID1AD.txt,"for example if a child sees a plastic horse on tv running around and jumping, it would think, that this horse is really able to do that, but it is not."
1270,1270,1177_aID1AD.txt,"furthermore, there would be some children, who want to get everything they see on tv and for poor parents, it would be really difficult to explain why their friends already own these things which seem to be important."
1271,1271,1177_aID1AD.txt,"but for the industry, it is easier to persuade children than adults who reflect their acting.they would not profit of this ban, although watching tv for young children is dangerous and unhealthy in general."
1272,1272,1177_aID1AD.txt,"to conclude, i think, these advertisements should not be allowed, because for the children, there is no benefit."
1273,1273,1177_aID1AD.txt,their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it.
1274,1274,1178_aID1AD.txt,in the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices.
1275,1275,1178_aID1AD.txt,"in the following text i will write about the aspects, which speak for or against the advertisment, which is directed to young children."
1276,1276,1178_aID1AD.txt,"the biggest argument against the advertisment is that, children are very easy to influece, because they do not have enough experience to know what is wrong and what is write."
1277,1277,1178_aID1AD.txt,"furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children."
1278,1278,1178_aID1AD.txt,"on the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products."
1279,1279,1178_aID1AD.txt,"but this aspect is just valuable, if the advertisment is supposed for children and does not have strongly influecing parts."
1280,1280,1178_aID1AD.txt,"maby the companies could make an advertisment, which gives the child useful information."
1281,1281,1178_aID1AD.txt,the information could be about important topics in our contemporary society for example about the responsable thing eith the nature.
1282,1282,1178_aID1AD.txt,"in conlusion i would say that  a special advertisment for children should only be allowed, if the advertisment is controlled by the parents or a kind of institute in the aspect of influece a learning."
1283,1283,1179_aID1AD.txt,"television directed toward young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not so often like adults, because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day."
1284,1284,1179_aID1AD.txt,moreover it is bad for the childrens eyes.
1285,1285,1179_aID1AD.txt,young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television.
1286,1286,1179_aID1AD.txt,but often young children can learn something by watching television.
1287,1287,1179_aID1AD.txt,an example is that they learn to treat the other children in the kindergarten better or learn to say different words.
1288,1288,1179_aID1AD.txt,also little children learn what is forbidden and what is right but they should watch series which are made for young children with an age of two to five.if they look criminal series it is not good for their evolution and they can missundertand what the people are doing.
1289,1289,1179_aID1AD.txt,televison advertising is not good for the childish brain because they do not know what is important and what is not but i do not think that it is bad if they watch it.
1290,1290,1179_aID1AD.txt,i disagree with this statement because it is not bad if little child seeing television advertising in this age but they should not watch it so often.
1291,1291,1181_aID1AD.txt,this essay is about the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
1292,1292,1181_aID1AD.txt,companies which sell for example toys or games are doing much television advertising directed toward young children.
1293,1293,1181_aID1AD.txt,children are easy to manipulate and if they want something really bad they often get it because their parents can not stand their cute child.
1294,1294,1181_aID1AD.txt,so the companies make much money with these advertising especially at chrismas time.
1295,1295,1181_aID1AD.txt,so it is kind of good for the industry and the tv channels.
1296,1296,1181_aID1AD.txt,but kids should not think they can have everything and those whose parents have not much money should not be shown what they miss.
1297,1297,1181_aID1AD.txt,besides should the media not be directed to so young kids.
1298,1298,1181_aID1AD.txt,children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media.
1299,1299,1181_aID1AD.txt,i would prefer it if the advertising of toys and other childish things would be directed to the parents and not to the child so that the parents can choose what they want to buy and the kid is happy about that one thing and does not want every toy in the advertising.
1300,1300,1182_aID1AD.txt,i would say the answer for this is very difficult.
1301,1301,1182_aID1AD.txt,"first off all it seems to manipulate the young children, because the things named in the advertisings are used to atract these young children.this works because they donâ´t even think about the price and if they really need these things."
1302,1302,1182_aID1AD.txt,"nevertheless, these children arenâ´t allowed / canâ´t even buy these things by themselfe."
1303,1303,1182_aID1AD.txt,so in the end the parents are the people who have to buy these things and have to spend their money on this.
1304,1304,1182_aID1AD.txt,"but when they donâ´t do this, their children start crying and behave absolutly stupid."
1305,1305,1182_aID1AD.txt,"so in the end both, children and parents, are mad."
1306,1306,1182_aID1AD.txt,"on the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television."
1307,1307,1182_aID1AD.txt,that is the normal reason to produce advertisings.
1308,1308,1182_aID1AD.txt,"it is the same aspect when you see some advertisings for adults, like an advertising for some good beer or a new video game."
1309,1309,1182_aID1AD.txt,also trailers of movies works like this - they have to make people interested in the topic of the movie.
1310,1310,1182_aID1AD.txt,"nevertheless, chilrden are much more open minded for advertisings, so it works much better with them instead of adults."
1311,1311,1183_aID1AD.txt,television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.
1312,1312,1183_aID1AD.txt,"there are some good points, but also many bad ones for the children."
1313,1313,1183_aID1AD.txt,"in this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life."
1314,1314,1183_aID1AD.txt,"television advertising can be good for a children, whose parents are very busy and do not have many time for their child."
1315,1315,1183_aID1AD.txt,"many television channels have learn programms for children, where children can learn for example languages or easy vocabulary."
1316,1316,1183_aID1AD.txt,"but it is not good for the children, to just sit in front of a tv and watch channels."
1317,1317,1183_aID1AD.txt,they need influences of their parents and of other kids.
1318,1318,1183_aID1AD.txt,"they need to go out to the playground, play with their friends and get social."
1319,1319,1183_aID1AD.txt,"i think that children, who sit the whole day in front of a television, will not educate as good as the ones, who go out and learn from their parents and from their activities."
1320,1320,1183_aID1AD.txt,"the other children will not learn, how to get friends and to communicate with different people."
1321,1321,1183_aID1AD.txt,"they will also not have a good relation to their parents, because they did not spend much time with them, when they were young."
1322,1322,1183_aID1AD.txt,"i think, that it is really important for a children to have a good relation to their mother and father."
1323,1323,1183_aID1AD.txt,"the position of parents is so important for children, because they learn from them and act like them."
1324,1324,1183_aID1AD.txt,"when they do not spend much time with their parents, when they are young it will have aftermath, when they are adults."
1325,1325,1183_aID1AD.txt,"when they go to school, they will possibly be a misfit, beacause they did not learn, how to make friends and be social."
1326,1326,1183_aID1AD.txt,"to conclusion, i agree with that statement, because the television advertising is not good for a well education of the children and the relation to family."
1327,1327,1184_aID1AD.txt,the question weather television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not ins't that easy to answer.
1328,1328,1184_aID1AD.txt,on the one hand the children are so small that they aren't able to reconize the fact that they get manipulated plus the fact that is pretty easy to do it because they don't have th ability to reflect things.
1329,1329,1184_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand ads can be an insparation for the kids independet from their parents.
1330,1330,1184_aID1AD.txt,they maybe get introduces to some different things which show them the diversity of the world.
1331,1331,1184_aID1AD.txt,an other negative point is that the childrens aren't abled to judge things regarding their quality or the need of it.
1332,1332,1184_aID1AD.txt,they are simply very easy to impress which makes them making desicions about spending money they don't have and can cause a lot of frustration if they don't get it.
1333,1333,1184_aID1AD.txt,but here we are at the point where the parents take place.
1334,1334,1184_aID1AD.txt,they are finally the one who decide weather to buy the advirtised product or not.
1335,1335,1184_aID1AD.txt,"they have also the exercise to teach their kids the handling of money, the use, treatment and importance of things and the moral behind it so that they have the power/need to change their kids minds."
1336,1336,1184_aID1AD.txt,all in one it is a big industry which is interestes in the childs opinion because they are good selling customers.
1337,1337,1184_aID1AD.txt,"it can be seen as ,regarding to the moral, false or as, regarding to the industry, good."
1338,1338,1184_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion there is nothing bad about directing television advertising to the children because they get into the diversity which exists and learn about the parents how to handle it.
1339,1339,1184_aID1AD.txt,the only problem which occures is that if the parents don't theach their children they might get too much manipulated and materialistic.
1340,1340,1185_aID1AD.txt,should television advertising be directed toward young children?
1341,1341,1185_aID1AD.txt,this is a well discused question and in the following i try to answer it.
1342,1342,1185_aID1AD.txt,"on the one hand a pro argument of showing these advertisings in tv is, that the products have mostly a pedagogic aspect, so the child learns new things."
1343,1343,1185_aID1AD.txt,"there are, for example, dolls, that talk with the child and it learns to speek."
1344,1344,1185_aID1AD.txt,"another good thing about the advertising is, that also the parents see them and might find new toys for their kids."
1345,1345,1185_aID1AD.txt,something they might not found without watching the advertise.
1346,1346,1185_aID1AD.txt,on the other hand children of this age have a high level of influence.
1347,1347,1185_aID1AD.txt,"the companies could sell them whatever they want, if they make the advertise colored and happy enough."
1348,1348,1185_aID1AD.txt,"at his age children can not decide what is good and what is bad, so if their hear for example: war is good, they maybe think this is true."
1349,1349,1185_aID1AD.txt,also children in young years should not watch television too much.
1350,1350,1185_aID1AD.txt,"making advertising for them, shows that there is a high number of children watching tv and if the companies would stop it, maybe not as much children would watch television."
1351,1351,1185_aID1AD.txt,watching too much tv is at this age not really good for the evolution.
1352,1352,1185_aID1AD.txt,"last but not least, the kids can become mad, when they see what the advertising offers and what they have in their room (e.g.toys)."
1353,1353,1185_aID1AD.txt,"they wont be as happy as they were, because the children want more and more things but can not always get them from their parents."
1354,1354,1185_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed.
1355,1355,1185_aID1AD.txt,"i think kids at this age should go outside and play and not watch tv the wohle day, and if they do, they should not be influenced by consumorientated companies, which just want to earn money and do whatever they can do to get it."
1356,1356,1187_aID1AD.txt,in the following text i will discuss the question if television advertising directed towards young children should be allowed or not.
1357,1357,1187_aID1AD.txt,"the first argument against ads for young children is, that they will probably not understand what the purpose of an ad is, so they will want to have the advertised item."
1358,1358,1187_aID1AD.txt,this will be expensive for the parents or the child and the parents are going to fight over it.
1359,1359,1187_aID1AD.txt,"an argument for advertising directed towards young children is, that they will see new things to play with and maybe they will get a bigger imagination or just new ideas."
1360,1360,1187_aID1AD.txt,but watching too much tv in general is not advisable for young children because they should play outside and think for their own instead of just getting their stories delivered through the tv.
1361,1361,1187_aID1AD.txt,"but also an argument for these ads is, that children can choose a new food they want to try or a new game they want to play because they have seen it in an advertisment."
1362,1362,1187_aID1AD.txt,they will quicker learn new things.
1363,1363,1187_aID1AD.txt,the next argument against advertising is that the companies who make these ads should not use the not-knowing of the children to make more money.
1364,1364,1187_aID1AD.txt,but the opposite of that argument is also an argument fot these ads if you see it from the perspective of the companies who then gain money.
1365,1365,1187_aID1AD.txt,gaining more money because of these ads is good for the companies and following from that also good for the economy of the country in which these ads are allowed in.
1366,1366,1187_aID1AD.txt,"another argument for these ads is, that if the children watch tv they are occupied because with different ads the tv program is different from day to day."
1367,1367,1187_aID1AD.txt,so the parents can do housework like cooking or doing laundry without really caring for the child for a few minutes.
1368,1368,1187_aID1AD.txt,"the last argument against ads directed toward young children is  
in my opinion the advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because the companies should not use young children in that way to get more money."
1369,1369,1187_aID1AD.txt,i think it is wrong.
1370,1370,1188_aID1AD.txt,"although to mutch consume of digital media like smartphones, computer and television isâ´t good at all for young children because it takes big influence on the way their brains develob in a negative way."
1371,1371,1188_aID1AD.txt,so responsibl parents shold act in a way not let their children whatch all of this ''junk'' tv.
1372,1372,1188_aID1AD.txt,"but if children of the age of two to fife years whatch tv, in germany they are often whatching ''superrtl'' and in this childfriendly program they publish many scenes showing violence and there is a lot of advertising to."
1373,1373,1188_aID1AD.txt,"and in the advertisin they show the newest and coolest toys and when these young children look at them, they emidiatly whant to have them."
1374,1374,1188_aID1AD.txt,"so in some famylies they get the new toys as quick as they publish them but some parends would say no and then, because of this normality of violence showen in tv, the children start to behave the same and not just at home but also in the kindergarden and at their friends homes."
1375,1375,1188_aID1AD.txt,in my opinion advertising should be banned out of childfriendly tv and they should also renew and think about what they show in this kind of tv and if this might be realy childfrtiendly.
1376,1376,1189_aID1AD.txt,"i think televesion towards young children in the age from two to five should not be allowed, because children in that age can be manipulated very easily."
1377,1377,1189_aID1AD.txt,"they can only watch it and cannot understand, what is shown in the advertisement."
1378,1378,1189_aID1AD.txt,"when there is a happy child in their age, which is playing with a specific toy from a specific brand, for the advertisement of this brand, the child wants to play with this toy too and it will try to make his parents give him that specific toy, because it canâ´t really understand that the advertisement it trying to make this effect."
1379,1379,1189_aID1AD.txt,"when an older child is watching television and sees an advertisement it can understand the things that take place in the advertisement and can see that the advertisement is only an child, who is only playing with this toy for the advertisement and they can make a differce between toys they really want and toys they only want, because the child in the advertisement seemed to be happy, while playing with this toy."
1380,1380,1189_aID1AD.txt,"but i think televison advertisement towards young children cannot be forbidden, because we live in a democratic state, where everybody can publish, what they wrote or filmed."
1381,1381,1189_aID1AD.txt,"i think you can only stop advertisement towards young cildren, when it is affecting them in a negative way and then you can only stop a specific spot."
1382,1382,1189_aID1AD.txt,"but the most advertisements are not affecting the children in a negative way, they only make the children want a toy."
1383,1383,1189_aID1AD.txt,"and i think that is a very important way for companys to sell their products, because this is the most affective and also the easiest way to reach the children and earn money by selling them specifc toys."
1384,1384,1189_aID1AD.txt,"so i think advertisement for children sould not be allowed, when it is affecting them in a negative way and sets them under a bad influence."
1385,1385,1189_aID1AD.txt,but when televison advertisement towards young children is not allowed it doesnâ´t stop that young children can be manipulated very easily and want most of the things they see.
1386,1386,1189_aID1AD.txt,so i think advertisement towards young children should be allowed.
1387,1387,1190_aID1AD.txt,i think children from 1 to 5 shouldnt watch television at all.
1388,1388,1190_aID1AD.txt,they should go outside and play and not sit inside and watch television.
1389,1389,1190_aID1AD.txt,in our society today all kids just sit inside and play with their tablats or phones that is very bad they dont receive the experience from playing outside the advanteruse in the forests or the scary dog from your neighbor they just knew the internet.
1390,1390,1190_aID1AD.txt,my generation ist i think the last who doesnt have phones or something in teir childhood we play outside with our friends and doesnt text over facebook or snapchat.
1391,1391,1190_aID1AD.txt,its scary because when you say to your child stop watching television and go outside  they have no idea what to do.
1392,1392,1190_aID1AD.txt,advertising in the television is not just bad for kids from 1 to 5 its also bad for adults.
1393,1393,1190_aID1AD.txt,the advertiser are very tricky and they know exactly ho to catch the people to buy things from them.
1394,1394,1190_aID1AD.txt,advertising should be stoped but  thats impossible because the concerns are too big and cannot be stoped.
1395,1395,1190_aID1AD.txt,advertising should not be allowed for kids up to 18 because its very dangerous and many kids buying things that they dont knew they really buy.
1396,1396,1190_aID1AD.txt,finally i think it should be stoped but its impossible.
1397,1397,1190_aID1AD.txt,advertsing is too big in the society today.
1398,1398,1190_aID1AD.txt,the only thing we can do is to take our kids away from the tv and take our time with them so they dont want watch tv anymore.
1399,1399,1191_aID1AD.txt,the following essay deals with the topic of allowing television advertising for young children from age two to five.
1400,1400,1191_aID1AD.txt,there are different reasons either supporting this advertising or not.
1401,1401,1191_aID1AD.txt,a good side of television advertisement is the fact that some products for children can be presented on tv and the children will talk to their parents about it.
1402,1402,1191_aID1AD.txt,"if the ads would only run on channels for adults, they probably would not listen or react to it as much as the young kids do."
1403,1403,1191_aID1AD.txt,many adults simply do not watch television advertisement.
1404,1404,1191_aID1AD.txt,having the children informed through television would be specifically great for selling the products as well as knowing all the products as a parent.
1405,1405,1191_aID1AD.txt,there are more bad things about this topic though.
1406,1406,1191_aID1AD.txt,the children could be annoyed in their young years by this form of advertisement.
1407,1407,1191_aID1AD.txt,it would always interrupt their shows and they really just would not like it at all.
1408,1408,1191_aID1AD.txt,in germany there is a tv-channel called kika which does not show any ads.
1409,1409,1191_aID1AD.txt,it makes watching the channel way better and the kids are not confronted with the breaks for advertisement.
1410,1410,1191_aID1AD.txt,in addition children would only see the product and what they are worth.
1411,1411,1191_aID1AD.txt,they would be teached to think about prices and owning products more than thinking about feelings and ethics.
1412,1412,1191_aID1AD.txt,they would want to have everything and that is a bad thing for our society in general because it should be all about what you think and how happy you are and not about owning every toy or all the money you can get.
1413,1413,1191_aID1AD.txt,all together i would agree with this statement.
1414,1414,1191_aID1AD.txt,i would say that television advertising should not be allowed on channels for children and for children in general.
1415,1415,1191_aID1AD.txt,it teaches wrong ideas of living in abundance and owning everything.
1416,1416,1191_aID1AD.txt,it is the parents' work and job to teach their growing youngs that things are just that much worth as you think they are and the advertisement shows a different idea just thinking about capitalism and making profit.
1417,1417,1192_aID1AD.txt,it would be hard to classify the advetisement.
1418,1418,1192_aID1AD.txt,is it for children aged two to five or for older kids?
1419,1419,1192_aID1AD.txt,the companys sponsering the ads could just claim that theyâ´re not aiming for the younger children.
1420,1420,1192_aID1AD.txt,but it would be very good if those television advertising would not be allowed anymore because those little children are very easy to manipulate.
1421,1421,1192_aID1AD.txt,for companys who produce products for kids aged thwo to five it would be a huge disadvantage if they canâ´t advertise their product anymore and would damage the financial situation of them.
1422,1422,1192_aID1AD.txt,"on the other side are the parents the ones who have to pay for the toys, sweets, etc of their children and the company use the kids because they are easier to manipulate to get the money from their parents."
1423,1423,1192_aID1AD.txt,using kids as things to get their parents money is ethicly bad.
1424,1424,1192_aID1AD.txt,i think it should not be allowed to direct television advertising toward young children because they are innocent.
1425,1425,1192_aID1AD.txt,they cant think of the consequences of their own acting and if they see something they like they want it.
1426,1426,1192_aID1AD.txt,this effect can be used to advert something with a lot of coulor and shining.
1427,1427,1192_aID1AD.txt,but the two to five year olds dont know that the ad just wants them to buy things.
1428,1428,1192_aID1AD.txt,"advertisement for adult people is oaky, they know the sence of an ad."
1429,1429,1193_aID1AD.txt,television advertising on specific products for children like candys or toys is designed exactly for their younger minds.
1430,1430,1193_aID1AD.txt,you can find this image also inside a supermarket.
1431,1431,1193_aID1AD.txt,"the sweets are placed right next to the counter, with the reason that the children ask their parents while paying their products if they can have some ""haribo"" for example."
1432,1432,1193_aID1AD.txt,the leaders of the market know exactly that they can play mindgames with younger people and earn more money in this way.
1433,1433,1193_aID1AD.txt,one reason for this is that young children don't have the experience to see if a product of their favour is useful or useless for them.
1434,1434,1193_aID1AD.txt,they also can't tell if it's worth the prize of it.
1435,1435,1193_aID1AD.txt,it is a skill that a human being achieves together with the process of growing up.
1436,1436,1193_aID1AD.txt,so adults are choosing more wisely which product they can effort and which not.
1437,1437,1193_aID1AD.txt,the only question is if the advert is for children and has no other thoughts behind or is designed to earn more money with a product that otherwise wouldn't sell that good.
1438,1438,1193_aID1AD.txt,i think that it's also the job of the parents to inform their kids to not believe everything what television adverts want to tell them.
1439,1439,1193_aID1AD.txt,so i would say that television advertising designed for young children is probably a bad thing for their parents money bag but should be allowed still for the reason that adverts for children most of the time don't want to steal your money and just want to show the product like every advert for an other product also does.
