0,I do not think there should be any legislative attempt towards restricting television advertising towards young children.,4
1,"The purpose of government is to protect the natural rights of its citizens, not to interfere in their lifes.",8
2,"Those natural rights include the right to life, to liberty and property, all aiming to give the people a maximum amount of freedom.",8
3,"Now, obviously a child does not posess the same ability to make choices as adults, so placing them under authority is essential to safe adolescence.",2
4,"This authority however, must be a parental one and not one of the state.",2
5,"It is completly unnecessary to restrict advertising because when growing up, parents can do a far better job at restricting influences on kids than the government because they have direct knowledge of their mental state.",4
6,Normalizing the grabbing of traditional tasks of parents could lead to an increasingly dangerous amount of power concentrated within legislation.,2
7,"In the following text i will discuss the following statment ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.",4
8,This statement confronts us with an actually theme.,11
9,Much children in this age watch much Tv and plays also games on a computer or tablet.,14
10,"Nowadays it gives much fims and series extra for children in this age, some who they learn something and other to have fun.",14
11,The most series want  to tell something to the kids an want that they learn much while they looking the films.,14
12,So they have a good aim.,3
13,"The most things children must learn they learn when they have some people arround them and explore something on their own, they must amke their own mistakes and experience and not a computerperson, who tells them something.",14
14,"Another point is that children needs much activities and must learn, how they can move their bodys correct.",13
15,"When they sits in front of the TV and watch series and films the whole day, they donÂ´t know how they make a thing by theyself.",9
16,"Also they donÂ´t build a own creativty or a own meaning, based on their experience, because they donÂ´t have own experience.",9
17,"When children have the chance to play in the garden and learn their something about the nature around them itÂ´s really much better and niecer for the kids, as a television advertising.",15
18,"On the one hand the films want the children to learn something what they need in their future and for the school, but on the other hand they confront them with unrealistic computercharacters, which looks really unreal.",14
19,"This is so since a few years, before it gave some nice series for children and not so much like today.",14
20,"The maincharacters their were normal animals or real humans, which talk to the kids.",14
21,"At the end you can say, that it should be not completly not allowed, but the children must have the chance to make their own experience and they should not be directed with television advertising every day.",3
22,"A little consum is not so bad, when the parents vote a good serie.",2
23,At the end you can they,3
24,"Advertising at the TV is a very useful way to speak to the people, but can young people, children, stand against the advertising?",4
25,"At first you have to say, that young children should not watch TV to much.",5
26,"If a child doesn't watch TV, the question of advertising you don't have to ask.",15
27,In addition children can find a present for his next birthday or for next christmas.,2
28,"It would be eassier for the parents to chose the right present, because they know, what the child wants, for example a new car or a new barbie.",2
29,Futhermore the children learn to say no to the things the advertising wants to sold you.,3
30,"This knowledge is something they have to learn for their live, so why can they learn it aged two to five?",13
31,"On the other side it give also many arguments, which are against the advertising at the telivision toward young children.",11
32,"The children have got many toys with they could play, but if they see the advertising they are not proud of their toys anymore.",15
33,"The toys on the TV are much better then their one, they think, so they want it.",15
34,This argument followed to the main statement you have to say at this topic.,2
35,"It doesn't matter, if they have a car or a barbie, the toys on the TV shows better then their one, so they need a new.",2
36,"Children don't understand it, if they don't get it, because they have something at home, but the parents can't buy everything, which is shown fantastic on the TV and this doesn't understand a child.",10
37,"So in my opinion advertising for children between two and five should not be allowed, because the prior arguments.",4
38,"If the children a little bit older, they can decide, which they really need and which not.",2
39,Television advertisement is something completely normal for us.,11
40,"However, should it be directed to young children or not?",1
41,It can influenz the children and change their personality so that they only look at their own needs and don`t take other people into consideration.,13
42,They develope a need for everything they see and get self-centered.,13
43,Children shouldn`t even watch TV long enough to see these advertisements.,1
44,Instead they should play with other kids outside and learn to share and communicate with them.,3
45,"But some TV programms can be useful, if they educate the children and increase their kreativity.",5
46,"Nonetheless there are advertisements on these channels, which might be good for them and the companies who placed these advertisements but it doesn`t help the children learn to share and play with other children.",15
47,"In my opinion there shouldn`t be television advertising directed to young children, because it only benefits the companies who make money with it.",4
48,These advertisements are only aimed at the money of the parents of the children.,1
49,"Furthermore, the children get the feeling they can have everything they want and don`t learn to value money.",10
50,I agree with this thesis because young children especially at an age from two to five are more likely to be caught by an advertisment.,4
51,"While they're watching his or her daily programm, which has an educative meaning for the children because it is the age in which they can learn the most and they schould do learn the most, the advertisements will lead to a feeling of need which would be connected with a greed.",15
52,The parents where 'forced' by crying or similar to buy a product which the child doesn't want but which it has to have.,2
53,Advertisements would manipulate children at all an in peticular at this age.,15
54,The time where all companies can make and want to make the largest profit possible.,12
55,Therefore they will make more advertisements and the cycle starts again.,11
56,"Another argument is that the time wasted by advertising spots could be filled by educative content like movies, series etc.",15
57,so instead of interrupting the childrens programm with manipulative advertisements they could be prepared for life in the long run.,3
58,"In order to conclude I would say that advertisements in the television programm of children is just a manipulative and somehow criminal way by the companies to gain as much profit as they can out of children, the weakest part of our population.",11
59,Therefore the government should strictly prohibit something like that.,16
60,"Televison advertisings towards young children is a discussed theme, because it can influence them, positive or negative.",11
61,Is it necessary to disallow these advertisings to children?,1
62,"The children spent a lot of time in watching television, more than before ten years.",5
63,"The companys know about this fact, and try to reach the children in advertisings where they talk directly to the children.",3
64,"It can be annoying for the parents, when their child wants everything, what seems to be attractive in the advertising, and also the children want to spend more time in front of the TV.",15
65,"I think, it is not necessary to disallow advertising towards young children, because on the one hand, they often don't understand, what is said there, and only see the product, also if they make an advert for a car, and on the other hand, the parents should rule the TV consume of their child, so it doesn't sees adverts like that all day.",4
66,In the past few weeks many people especially parents care about one big problem.,2
67,They criticize the use of television advertising directed toward young children.,11
68,But does this topic really brings this much problems or is it not even bad?,7
69,On the one hand adverts towards young children is a great oppotunity for the concerns.,4
70,The kids have a strong will and the parents want to do them a favor and buy the products.,2
71,But on the other hand children can hardly understand what it means to buy something.,10
72,They do not understand what money means.,10
73,If the parents donÂ´t have the money or even just do not want to spend it it comes to argues between the parents and their children.,2
74,Another argument for the use of advertising toward young children is that they can decide what they want and that they learn fast that there are many toys but they can not have all of them.,15
75,They learn to understand what it means to get something they want to have.,13
76,The concerns set themselves on an higher level than the parents.,2
77,If a mother does not want their children to know this toy she has to forbid them to watch TV.,6
78,Furthermore the shops just use the kids.,2
79,Surely they know all this points but they just ignore them because they want to sell as many things as possible.,17
80,To sum up this topic really is a problem.,7
81,On the one hand you cand understand the shops that want to make money but on the other hand you have the parents that just want to protect their small children.,2
82,And I can totally agree with the parents and the statement on the top.,2
83,It can not be respected that the children can see anything even if their parents donÂ´t want to.,6
84,In the newspaper there was a discussion about television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.,4
85,In my essay I will discuss this question.,13
86,"Young children aged from two to five should not be allowed to direct television advertising, because they don't know anything about television advertising.",4
87,They are too young and perhaps in advertising there will be shown how little children have to behave.,3
88,On the one hand they could learn something but on the other hand their parents show their children to behave differently.,13
89,This is the reason why children get confused.,10
90,"In some ways if the children look every time this advertising, they will behave like it was shown in the advertising.",15
91,For children aged from two to five it is necessary to interact with their parents because parents have the most influence of their life.,13
92,Otherwise they don't learn anything about communication and often the advertising doesn't reach the young children.,15
93,"Advertising was created to earn a lot of money, that people watching the TV will buy what was shown in the advertising.",11
94,In some way advertising can have a big impact on somebodys life and this isn't positive.,11
95,"In my oppionion I think television advertisng directed toward young children should not be allowed, because as I said above, they are too young.",4
96,In their first years they have to learn how to behave by their parents.,13
97,Televison advertising can have a lot of negative things because most people don't think about it and they do what was said in the advertising.,11
98,"An argument for the television advertising directed toward children (aged two to five) is they can learn something about the products they are , in some cases, interested to buy or let buy.",15
99,"Consequently they could choose a game of many others that seems to be the coolest or funiest, if they compare the different advertisments.",15
100,"Thats why kids would be more often settisfying because the parents could buy things the children are want to, if they agree with their selection.",2
101,There are more and stronger arguments against advertisments for young children.,4
102,"One of this is that boys and girls in this age should not be confronted with so much media which would be more if they also must look for a lot of advertisments, if they want to have a new doll or something else.",15
103,The most important argument is that kids are not able to handle with advertisments because they don not understand something about trading.,0
104,"The reason for this is that kids aged two to five have not the ability to quote about the advertisment and exspecially about the products, because the seller has a big influence to the feelings, with this always positive advertisments about the products.",15
105,Thats why children want things which are for example not even worth to buy.,10
106,"To summ up this theme, I am against televesion advertising direct toward young children, because there are much stronger aspects against it.",4
107,Parents should decide what is worth to buy for their kids.,2
108,Television advertising for so young children has good and bad sites.,11
109,It's important which progam they are watching and what kind of influense this program has.,6
110,It is good when the children watch a television program that prepares them for the school but television that has an bad influense and dont prepare them is not good for them when they watch it too often.,5
111,"The parents have to controle the children and what they are watching, so that they can protect them towards those programms with such a bad influense.",6
112,But it doesn't make sense when the parents of these young children don't care about what their children are watching and the producers of these television programs often don't care too cause they only want money.,6
113,It's not important wether the children sometimes watch those series or movies which don't teach them so much like series who prepare them for the elementary school or the complete school in one thing but they shouldn't watch the too often.,14
114,I don't agree with this statement because i think that children should have fun and a good childhood.,2
115,Television is included in our modern social life and we should allow them to grow up with these things.,5
116,"Some children are very good in elementary school because they watched such teaching children-series like ""Dora"" or ""Toggolino"" and some are not so good and too hyperactive because they always watched series like ""Spongebob Schwammkopf"" and only that so that only this fictional cartoon character was they",14
