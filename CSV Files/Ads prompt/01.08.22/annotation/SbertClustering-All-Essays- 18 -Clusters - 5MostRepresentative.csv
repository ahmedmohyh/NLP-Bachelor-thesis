0,Did young children bacame addicted to modern technic?,0,0
1,"First, television is not good for young children, and many of these young children aren`t even allowed to watch TV.",1,7
2,In my opinion young children should generally just spend a small amount of time watching television.,1,3
3,Television is a too important factor of the life of a young children.,1,2
4,In my view young children aged two to five should may watch television but it have to be regulatged by the parents.,1,16
5,"However the television can be nessecary, because some kids have an evening routine in which they watch one serie of their favourite movie 
and afterwards they go better to sleep.",1,2
6,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",2,16
7,But when televison advertisement towards young children is not allowed it doesnÂ´t stop that young children can be manipulated very easily and want most of the things they see.,2,10
8,The children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money.,2,16
9,"My opinion to this topic is, that televsion  advertising directed to young children should be stopped.",2,7
10,"But companys earn a lot of money with this television advertising, so it would be hard to forbidden televison advertising toward young children.",2,10
11,"But children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them, they will be really unhappy.",3,10
12,So the toy-industry needs the advertising toward young children to sell their products and get money.,3,10
13,"Sure, there are other people who say that thats the concept of advertising but most people do not want to buy some things to their children and experience that they donÂ´t use it or play with it.",3,16
14,"When only parents would get advertisements for toys, most of them would not really care about it and they probably would not buy the toy the kid would have chose - especially the more expensive ones.",3,16
15,Children should decide themselves what they want and advertising helps them to gain information about the things they could possibly need.,3,6
16,So they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour.,4,3
17,"The children believe every word and can get a wrong image   of what is realy important in life, because they do not have any experiences like that yet.",4,9
18,"If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life.",4,5
19,"And if they weren`t confronted by advertisements and the `no` of their parents, they never learn it.",4,4
20,When they watch television and there comes an advertising they see something and the parents have to say: no you can`t get it.,4,16
21,"Furthermore, children cannot make own decisions yet, they are controlled by their parents or adults in general.",5,16
22,But if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine.,5,16
23,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,5,16
24,The parents have the chance to decide what the child does and what is bought in the end.,5,16
25,"By far the best point to make is that no matter what the child wants, no matter how sad it will get, everything is always up to the parents.",5,16
26,They cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant.,6,13
27,They do not always understand that everything they see coasts money and that advertisment has just one use - convincing people to buy the product.,6,13
28,Besides they do not care about the advertising and would not understand the background reasons for it.,6,13
29,They are finally the one who decide weather to buy the advirtised product or not.,6,16
30,"Sure, there are other people who say that thats the concept of advertising but most people do not want to buy some things to their children and experience that they donÂ´t use it or play with it.",6,16
31,"They will then ask their parent to buy it, but a lot of parents cannot spend as much money at toys even if they want to.",7,16
32,Some parents will maybe buy the toys and then do not have enough money left for other things.,7,12
33,"And if the parents have a lot of money and don't care about what they buy in the first place, why not show these children some cool toys on TV to make them happy?",7,12
34,"Children also can't judge if something isn't worth the money it costs, that's why they would want to have the item no matter what, and the parents have to deal with the crying children if they can't afford a new toy for them.",7,12
35,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",7,12
36,Nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches TV.,8,17
37,Television advertising is getting more and more popular in the society.,8,17
38,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV.",8,17
39,"Nowdays, advertising is a normal part of the television.",8,17
40,"On the other side, advertisings are made to interest people and to make them buy the things shown in the television.",8,10
41,"Parents should make sure that their children grows up with things, which are important fot theier future.",9,1
42,Another important thing is the knowledge of the children.,9,2
43,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,9,1
44,But an important thing is also that there are lots of educating movies and series which help the children to live or preparing their life.,9,2
45,Children in these years are in an important part of  their life.,9,2
46,Advertisements would only steal them their expensive and very short time.,10,10
47,If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.,11,4
48,"If they don't learn this, they could have problems in their life.",11,4
49,They learn things from them like how to behave in some situations.,11,4
50,"When they do not spend much time with their parents, when they are young it will have aftermath, when they are adults.",11,4
51,"Sometimes the children learn something, they shouldnÂ´t learn.",11,15
52,"I agree with the following statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"".",12,0
53,"In the following I tell you my oppinion of the question, if Television advertising directed toward young children between two to five years shuold not be allowed.",12,0
54,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",12,0
55,Personally I think that the Television advertising directly towards young children should not be allowed because the children are in they own developement aged two to five.,12,7
56,So it may occure the question whether TV advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) shoud or should not be allowed.,12,0
57,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",13,3
58,Advertising addressed to young children can create both a passion for life and a bad habit negatively incluencing one's life.,13,0
59,But there are also some reasons for advertisements towars young children.,13,0
60,"Advertisement for children does not have to be a bad thing, it can be used to influence them so that their behaviour will have a positive effekt on society and nature.",13,2
61,I think children maybe donÂ´t want advertising that is directed toward them.,13,0
62,So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people.,14,18
63,"In this chapter of their life, they normally have to play outside with friends and don`t have to sit in their room and watch tv.",14,18
64,"For example, children with the age of two to five should reed some books or play games like football.",14,18
65,Children in this age should go outside and enjoy their childhood and do not sit inside infront of the television or other media.,14,18
66,ItÂ´s better for them to play in the kindergarten or to play with their mum.,14,18
67,Young children can be influenced easily.,15,9
68,Young children can be easiliy influenced by everything.,15,9
69,"First of all it is well-known that little children are heavily influenced by their surroundings, so that they can get manipulated easily as well.",15,9
70,That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+,15,9
71,But when televison advertisement towards young children is not allowed it doesnÂ´t stop that young children can be manipulated very easily and want most of the things they see.,15,9
72,In  the following text I am going to name reasons for and against this statement and show my own opinion.,16,0
73,In the following I will discuss this statement.,16,0
74,In the following I will present my opinion on this topic.,16,0
75,In my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples.,16,0
76,"As a result I agree with the statement, because there are a lot of disadvantages and only a few advantages.",16,0
77,So that Television is an important source for young children for preparing their future life.,17,2
78,Otherwise young children can learn many things just with watching TV.,17,2
79,First of all you have to say that the television has a big influence not just on young children but on everyone of us.,17,9
80,Especially young children are getting easily influenced by television.,17,2
81,On the other side it could be an advantage for the children to wtach TV even at a so young age.,17,2
