1,Until this it seems to be fairly normal but what what follows is truly malicious; The whole time the spot was set in motion there has been some kind of ultra-high frequency tone which was not hearable for the human ear but unfortunately it affected our brain and made us want to purchase that product.,0,2,,,,,,,,C0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,

22,Furthermore could the other kids begin to bully a kid who has not got the best toy like they said in the advertise.,7,13,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
23,Even if actually playing with the toy isnÂ´t funny at all or might be boring the good advertising shows of the perfect toy that you need to have.,7,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
24,"Last but not least the parents of those children are watching TV aswell, and so it would just remain more of a mental problem, because the parents are rather buying things that are shown in advertisements, than things that were never shown.",8,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
25,"If parents dont allow their child to watch television, but the others do, then it may be excluded from the group, because the other children talkt about it and may get the newest products.",8,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
26,"They don't have the chance of really being a kid, without adverts to care about.In addiction, I think it would be better for our environment.",8,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
27,"An other point is, that if parents let their children watch television, at this age, it's their resposibility of what their children actually get to see and advertisements are just part of the television business.",9,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
28,"So in my opinion it could be allowed for young children if they donÂ´t look that much at the teleevision and  if they look films or other tv-shows which are acceptable for their age and not with violence or other things which arenÂ´t good for children at this age.But if the parents donÂ´t do that so that their children look a couple of hours at the televsion, then it should not be allowed for them to look that much.",9,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
29,Some advertsiments may be to brutal for young children but I think parents should have a look on what their kids are watching because only they know what is good for them in this age because every children is different.,9,1,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
30,That sounds like the companies that make adverts for children lose more money by putting the advertisement on national television than for actually selling the product.,10,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
31,"Nevertheless, advertisements are boring and definitely not interesting enough for young children, so why should companies invest in more advertising and thus spend more money on marketing their products, if it is not a hundred percent sure whether or not the children and their parents would actually buy the advertised products.",10,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
32,"Usually, they are not capable of judging a situation like adults are and this makes it easier for companies to convince children of their products.",10,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
33,I will discuss this situation in the following essay.,11,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
34,"Well, this will be shown in the following essay.",11,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
35,This will be discussed in the following.,11,0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
36,"In this case it would not be wrong to direct advertising especially to children instead of adults, it is even more interesting for them.",12,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
37,I think people would like to have advertising towards young children banned because they think that these young children will get baited way too easy and kinda fall for the advertisement.,12,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
38,"Personally, I think television advertising towarts little children should not be allowed, because it is not fair or right to manipulate and trick them into buying things.",12,10,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
39,The problem is that children from two to five arenÂ´t even able to read in this age so they start watching TV before they are able to read a book.,13,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
40,Finally I want to remark that watching TV in this age (from two to five) can cause brain damages.,13,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
41,Maybe the two to five aged children are sitting to near to the sreen and get problems witch their eyes later on.,13,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
42,This will make the children get mad at their parents because they think they do not want to buy them a certain toy but actually they just can not afford it.,14,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
43,"Of course, children can always tell their parents what they want, but its still up to them what they actually buy.",14,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
44,"This is good for the product, but the parents won't be that happy with it and the children, who probably don't get what they want, neither.",14,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
45,Nearly everybody is always online so a question must be asked: If our society is based on media and of cause also on television why shouldn't we confrontate our children with television advertising to show them a part of our world and their future?,15,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
46,On balance I think that this is a topic that should be discussed  more beacuse nowadays we are living in a world full of advertisings and manipulation.,15,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
47,"Another reason is, that the advertises can push people in our ""consumer society"" and I think it's importat to protect the childrem from becoming part of that at an age, where they can't really build an own opinion about the world.",15,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
48,"A reason tho allow televison advertising directed toward young children is, that they will be confornted with it sooner or later no matter what.",16,17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
49,I think the positive ones do overweight and I hope there won't be less television advertising directed toward young children.,16,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
50,"I am not against the idea of forbidding television advertisement directed toward young children, I just donÂ´t think, itÂ´s the way how advertising should be handled.",16,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
51,"If the parents donÂ´t let their children watching TV the whole day the risk of influecing ads is not so high, but children like to watch TV extremly long, so they have to find a compromiss.",17,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
52,"The children who sit in front of the TV and wait until their show goes on, they watch those advertisings and probably going to be influenced by that.",17,15,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
53,"It is easy for parents to just let their children sit infront of the TV, where they can watch their favorite shows, sometimes educational, sometimes not.",17,14,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
54,I definitely agree with this statement.,18,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
55,In conclusion I totally agree with this statement.,18,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
56,I absolutely agree with this statement.,18,8,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
