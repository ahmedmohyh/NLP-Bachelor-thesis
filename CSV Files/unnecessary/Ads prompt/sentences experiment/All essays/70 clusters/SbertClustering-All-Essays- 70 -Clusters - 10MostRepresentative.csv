0,Most of them are for advertising clothes or parfumes for adults but some exist which concern small children between kindergarden and preschool.,0
1,All in all I can say that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because they are too young to understand that they want to sell products.,1
2,All in all you can say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it influences them too much and makes them believe in things that do not exist.,1
3,In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of several reasons.,1
4,"The statement "" television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"" is not easily to answer.",1
5,In my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because the children can be manipulated so that the children want something that isn't necessary.,1
6,"In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children, as they are manipulative and create a world which does not exist.",1
7,"To sum up, in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shoud not be allowed as it is manipulating, influences their development and harms the environment.",1
8,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion.",1
9,So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed since all the arguments which say that it should not be permmitted can be easily,1
10,In my humble opininon television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.,1
11,They often like advertisements to discover new toys and there are as well advertisements which support the education of the children.,2
12,The purpose of these adverts is to awaken the interest in these children for asking their mommy or daddy to buy them these toys.,2
13,"Often the advertisment shows new toys, the children want immediately because they are so easy to influence and sometimes don't even know what the advertisments are.",2
14,"Additionally, the child possibly enjoys those advertisings since watching those funny advertisings becomes more exciting than actually playing with the toys.",2
15,"Whether it is the newest Nerf dart gun or a Hot Wheels toy car track, the same children's adverts are broadcast time and time again on various channels in an attempt to persuade children to persuade their parents to buy a certain product.",2
16,"Even if the ad just introduces new toys or games, children will get attracted to it and will certainly want to buy them due to the lack of rational decision skills.",2
17,"Firstly, many advertising spots are about pruducts which adults or teenager would buy and not toys or something children would like to see.",2
18,There are many advertising for toys or other things directed toward young children.,2
19,"Plus, the advertisings are also a help for the parents to know what goods are on the market and which toys can actually educate their child.",2
20,"But these advertisings also manipulate the children a bit, because on these advertisings only a few things are shown and they are shown in that way, that the kids think ist the best toy ever, and the toys are often diffrent, than in the advertising.",2
21,I agree with this following statement.,3
22,"in my opinion, I agree with the statement.",3
23,yes I agree with this statement.,3
24,I agree with this statement for the following reasons.,3
25,I agree with the statement.,3
26,I agree with the statement.,3
27,I agree with the statement.,3
28,I agree with the statement for the following reasons.,3
29,"To start off, I disagree with the statement.",3
30,"To summarise, I think don't agree with the statement compleatly.",3
31,"Even if they know what the aim of advertisement is, they are influenced by it and buy often things they saw in television advertising.",4
32,Those advertising can influence their mind and how they will think and act later.,4
33,"On the other side, they maybe learn early that the advertisment is something to look at critcal because there are different strathegies to manipulate the people.",4
34,The Television advertising influence their mind.,4
35,"When they watch too much television, they see definitely advertising, which they shoudn't see.",4
36,They might be influenced by the advertisements in a bad way.,4
37,They don't realize that all those advertisements are made from huge companys which want to earn as much money as possible.,4
38,It's possible that they are even shocked and frightened by the adverts.,4
39,When it comes to advertisements they could also be convinced to want certain things that are shown on TV.,4
40,They don't understand that they got influenced by the advertising and thats the problem.,4
41,Maybe the parents should not let theit children watch television on their own.,5
42,There are many children who spend a lot of time infront of the TV and parents do not really pay attention to what their children are watching.,5
43,Nowadays many parents allow their children to watch TV.,5
44,"On one hand, the parents can decide by themselfes wheter or wheter not they want their kid to sit in front of television.",5
45,In my opinion the parents of a child should really try to cotrole the time their children will sit in front of a TV.,5
46,"Of course the children shouldn't spend too much time in front of a TV, but that's the thing parents should be keeping an eye on normally.",5
47,"First of all, the parents can control the time that their children spend in front of the television.",5
48,I think you have to chose if you want that your children watching television or not.,5
49,If parents allow their kid to watch TV they also have to know what they will see.,5
50,"They often watch television when their parents are somewhere around the house, so it should actually be in the responsibilty of the parents to look after their kids and to controll what they are watching on TV.",5
51,Their minds are not fully developed and are easy to influence.,6
52,They can't realise and canalise what they see.,6
53,On top of that they do not reconize when they are influenced.,6
54,They try to copy things around them and because of that they are greatly manipulated by such messages.,6
55,They are not capable to differentiate the importance of things in life because they do not have the exprience they need.,6
56,They are helpless and can not understand that they are influenced.,6
57,Another point is that they tend to do what they see.,6
58,So they dont think on their own.,6
59,They often don't have their own opinion yet.,6
60,So they get brainwashed in a way.,6
61,But if the parents do not buy the stuff the children can get very angry an ennoying.,7
62,The problem of this is that often young children just want everything and they can't decide what really is worth to buy and then the parents will buy it for their children to not disapoint them.,7
63,"If their child wants something, they will know that and then they can decide, if they want to buy that or not.",7
64,They may want to buy more and more and won't accept if the parents won't buy them the things shown in the advertisements.,7
65,"The parents couldn't and shouldn't buy everything their children wants, but children don't unterstand it, when the parents say no, because they are too young for it.",7
66,"Furthermore, the parents can have a really hard time convincing the young children not to buy something, when they have seen it on television and think it would be cool to have it.",7
67,The parents might can not offer so much money for this stuff but the children are so manipulated so they will get there parents to buy anything they want.,7
68,If childrens see something they want parents often have to give in and go buy it for them.,7
69,But the childrens in thes ages can't buy something on their own so the parents have to accept it.,7
70,"Of course also the parents don`t want to buy all the useless, advertised things.",7
71,The children are open minded and if you show them in their early years a childrenfriendly Sierie they maybe could learn something.,8
72,Furthermore the child can learn about moral and friendship.,8
73,The children have to learn how to feel and how to react to other people feelings.,8
74,Moreover the parents are responsible for teaching some things to their kids.,8
75,They now that the children could influence their parnts quite much.,8
76,The young children have to build their own future and it would be helpfull if they get to know our world in their young ages.,8
77,"The children has to learn things also outside and do something and they have to be activ when they are so young, they don't have to sit at home infront of the television and doing and learning nothing.",8
78,One argument is that the childrens could learn something.,8
79,"This influences how the kids see themselves, how they think their life has to be.",8
80,"The young children should learn things from the parents and they have to go to school, so the chan learn thing that are importent.",8
81,"Children shouldn't watch television anyway, they should go out and play with other childen, so there isn't any problem with advertisings.",9
82,Most of the children aged two to five will watch tv everyday so it does not matter if they are watching advertising made for them or not.,9
83,"Nowadays more kids watch television than ever, therefore it makes sence to direct the advertising towards them.",9
84,In television you see not just movies or series you also see a lot of advertising directed toward young children.,9
85,There shouldn't be advertisment for young children in the television because then kids tend to watch television and that's not good.,9
86,"But children do not only watch the TV shows, but also the advertising inbetween.",9
87,"For one, children of this age are not supposed to be watching much television in the first place so it wouldn't actually be very useful to direct advertisments at them.",9
88,"Children are not watching tv for the sake of advertisment, they are watching it because they love a certain movie or they want to watch their beloved series.",9
89,There are TV channels which are in particular for children and surely they also have advertising.,9
90,While the parents let their children to watch childfriendly series on the TV there are also a lot of advertising.,9

101,Another point is that the health could become bad.,11
102,On the other side it can have positive afffection to the children.,11
103,"That sounds very negative for sure, but it can definitely cause some harm.",11
104,It could lead to psycial problems which is really dangerous in this age.,11
105,Because of this it could happen bad things.,11
106,Over a short part of time it haven't any bad consequences.,11
107,It is not good for them.,11
108,But it can also lead to other problems.,11
109,It can cause a few troubles.,11
110,This can have bad consequences for the future or their lifestyle.,11
111,Today's television programs consists of a lot of advertisements to.,12
112,Most television channels contain ads.,12
113,But in between the TV programme there is a lot of advertising too.,12
114,You can't turn on the TV and watch a movie without having some breaks for advertising.,12
115,In television there is a lot of advertising.,12
116,Nowadays there is often even more advertising than actual broadcasting on tv.,12
117,"So many parts of the today's television is the advertising, when we watch it in the evening there is an advertising break about all 15 minutes.",12
118,"Near to all TV shows, movies and so on, are interrupted by advertising.",12
119,A big part of today's television is advertisement.,12
120,Today it is normal that television advertising is commmon and in every break of a film for example there are a lot of advertisings.,12
121,Advertising becomes more and more important in our world.,13
122,Advertising is very important for selling products.,13
123,Advertising plays quite an important role in our society.,13
124,In the modern world advertising becomes more and more important.,13
125,Advertising can not only be found on television but all over the place.,13
126,Advertisement has become more and more popular.,13
127,Advertisings in general do occupy a big aspect in our daily lifes.,13
128,Advertising can be seen in all places in our everyday life.,13
129,Today advertising is part of our everyday life.,13
130,Advertisment is a big subject in the world of today.,13
131,"But on the other hand they should learn, that they can't have everything in life and that the job of advertising is to get you to want to buy this particular product.",14
132,They should learn that advertisements don't really show the real things and they can't just have anything they want.,14
133,They should learn that advertising isn't always the truth and can be misleading.,14
134,"Television advertising generally presents sweets in a way, as if it were glorifying them and it's terrible that children think that unhealthy food is valuable.",15
135,"Children don't know what's good for them and what not and advertising can give them a false idea of sweets, for example.",15
136,On the other hand it is not good if children see an advertisment for things like chocolate or any other kind of sweets because they would want to buy it although it is not healthy for them.,15
137,Children will think that fast food and sweets are the main nutrition.,15
138,Advertising sweets very often could lead to a more obese youth.,15
139,If they watch plenty of ads in which other kids seem to have fun while eating unhealthy food they'll think it could also be a good thing for them.,15
140,"So if they see a funny advertising of McDonald`s in TV that, overall even promises them a toy delivered with their happy meal, they might feel the need to eat unhealthy things, which is rather bad.",15
141,If the parents allow them to have these kind food then they could get addicted to it.,15
142,They maybe can understand from an advertisment about chocolate or other sweets that unhealthy food is good and makes happy.,15
143,Because if you show a child an advert of unhealthy food everyday it will remember it at some stage and will be influenced by the advert.,15
144,There are arguments for and against this topic.,16
145,There are many arguments for and many against.,16
146,"In conclusion, there are many different opinions about this subject and not a simple solution.",16
147,There are arguments for and against it.,16
148,There are several arguments that speak for and against it.,16
149,Now i want to show some arguments for and against this and in the end summarize my opinion.,16
150,It shurely is a widely discussed and important topic with good arguments on both sides.,16
151,"First I like to mention a positive argument, why it should be allowed.",16
152,"As always, there are also reasons why it should be allowed.",16
153,There are arguments for and against it and it isn't easy to decide wether it should be allowed or not.,16
154,And companies need to sell they're product aswell and advertings them is a pretty good way.,17
155,Also the companies have other ways to raise their sells.,17
156,"Companys need to be able to promote their product and through that actually sell them, that's what let's our economy going.",17
157,"Many companies
have commercial tactics that help them to sell more products.",17
158,"If companys have many loyal customers, they canactually do what they want.",17
159,In my opinion the companies just want take advantage out of that.,17
160,It's also a good way for the company to make a huge amount of money.,17
161,And this is the point where the companys can make so much profit.,17
162,This point makes it seemingly obvious that it is no good idea reffering to the specific companies sake to waste so much money in order to influence persons which are not even able to buy something on their own but do not give in such an easy way and think about it a bit more.,17
163,"On the other hand, the companys earn their money like this.",17
164,Some advertisements may have negative impact on certain people or even society in general.,18
165,"Besides, some advertisments are made for another group of people, for example teenagers or adults, so it has a bad influence on them.",18
166,Some people may think that television advertisement is something  bad.,18
167,"Advertisements also have bad aspects, especially for children.",18
168,Another point is that advertisment could be bad as well because it is controlled by the product which is presenting.,18
169,"In my opinion, advertising has more bad aspects than goods.",18
170,Advertisment is not only the bad component of it.,18
171,On one hand I think advertisement in general is a bad thing.,18
172,However advertising isn't always a bad thing.,18
173,Advertising is something that we are confronted with every day of our lifes.,18
174,My personal opinion is that the children shouldn't be influenced by this kinds of things.,19
175,The parents should be carefull of what they permit their children to see and what not to.,19
176,Some people think that this could have a bad influence to young children between two and five years old.,19
177,"In conclusion, i think showing adds to little children is a very bad idea.",19
178,"There are a lot of things children shouldn't be watching and as long as they are not watching it, there is no problem.",19
179,"And if their parents do not care about what the children are watching or do not teach them how things really are, these children might get problems in their future.",19
180,"But children have a chance to watch things, they not good for the children.",19
181,"First I have to mention that young children can get influenced very easily, so the society should be careful with whatever they show them.",19
182,In my opinion I think it's not a great idea to influent the mind of the children.,19
183,"It isn't good for the young children to do such things, because the have to discover the world and play with other children.",19
184,On the one hand children of the age two to five shouldnt be watching too much TV anyways as it isnt ideal for their age group.,20
185,"In the end I personally think that it is okay to let young children watch television, if it is not too much.",20
186,"First of all I like to mention, that in my opinion children in the age from two to five should not even be allowed to watch TV at all.",20
187,In my opinion children in the age from two to five shoulden't watch television anyway.,20
188,"I think, children generally shouldn't watch television a lot.",20
189,I think a child of the age two to five shouldn't be wathcing a lot of television anyways.,20
190,In my opinion young children should not watch a lot of television in general.,20
191,"On the whole, young childeren should not be watching a lot of television at such a young age.",20
192,In my opinion it`s no good to let children watch TV.,20
193,A lot of people think that young children (age two to five) should not be in contact with television.,20

298,In our society television playes a remarkable role in many peoples lifes.,32
299,Nowadays lots of people watch television.,32
300,"Nowadays, television has become to a need of todays society.",32
301,In our todays life the television is a big part of our world.,32
302,"Television is a part of our daily life, we watch it to relax, for entertaining reasons, to informate us, what happen around the globe.",32
303,Watching television has become part of our daily life.,32
304,In our modern society we often watch television.,32
305,The only solution I see for this problem is a change in the thinking of the society as a whole.,33
306,"And if we are able to stop one source of influence, than we should to that.",33
307,"In conclusion, we should bloody stop to always make big problems up which are our own faults and to understand that we - if we want it or not - still bear responsibility, especially for those who should be under our protection.",33
308,"This fear may be reasonable, but it is just how the world works.",33
309,In this way we support this huge problem.,33
310,"Through this kind of development, which we can/ have during the last years, we have to do something against this trend.",33
311,We have other problems to look after.,33
312,"On the other hand, what can we do about it?",33
313,In the end our world is gettinh worse and worse everyday we live by.,33
314,We have a lot of other problems which we have to solve and this isn`t that important.,33
315,Also young children can learn.,34
316,The young childrens can learn a lot of things.,34
317,Children aged two to five have to learn very much about live.,34
318,"In this time of their life, children are learning very much, for example how to communicate with others.",34
319,They can learn some new things with fun.,34
320,Childrens want to learn about the world.,34
321,It is importat that children learn thing.,34
322,It can be a good thing for young children to learn about such things from an early age.,34
323,"It is important to show them the life in different kind of ways, how they could learn to communicate or to talk or how to behave while being with other people.",34
324,Althrough there are also chances for examples the children know how the world looks like and some programms have good series for learning something.,34
325,"A big point against the advertising is, that children get influenced by advertisings and even more if they're young.",35
326,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",35
327,"In conclusion, these advertisings give the children a false view of things, they increase problem between parent and child, and sometimes, they just confuse them.",35
328,"Studies show how the mind can be subconciously influenced by advertising and to make such advertisements for children is a rather dangerous thing, because the brain of a child is yet to be fully developed.",35
329,"First of all, young children are influenced by advertising more than older ones.",35
330,"In this young age the children do not know what is good or wrong all in all, so advertising directed to children can change their opinion, mind or development.",35
331,"Moreover, children can't really react on the advertisings, because they don't have money to buy something by themselves so the goal of an advertising isn't reached anyway.",35
332,Young childrens could miss understand the meaning of the advertising and get influenced by them.,35
333,If kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal.,35
334,There are also children who are influenced by the advertisements in another way.,35
335,But more important is that the children are a lot influenced by tv or smartphones already on this age!,36
336,Because of television ant its advertisments the young children will get an impression of how the technology works and what it is for.,36
337,In todays society there are a lot of small children who grow up with the use of computers and television.,36
338,"Children at this age are easily influenced and it can make raising a child even harder if it is constantly exposed to ""all the cool new stuff that you definitely need"".",36
339,Nowadays children watch too much television that are are so much influenced by electronic devices.,36
340,"In todays life even young children get in contact with new technologies like computers, smartphones and also television.",36
341,"I'm agree that many young children use mobilephones, television or other electric stuff.",36
342,"In the modern era of technology a massive influence is lead towards children, starting from a young age.",36
343,In our time childs are often confronted with televisions or smartphones.,36
344,"Furthermore young children have the oppertunity to play with friends, with their parents or with toys and everybody knows that children have lots of toys.",36
345,then it won't cost too much time.,37
346,But if it would be possible in a way I would say it shouldn't be allowed.,37
347,In this case I think it's better to do this not.,37
348,That's a way too so solve the problem and to still not forbidding a comercial.,37
349,Otherwise I don't see a problem why it shouldn't be allowed.,37
350,This is the problem in that case.,37
351,"So the real question is if a very strict rule like forbit it completely, is really the way to solve the problem.",37
352,"But many companies don't care, since it works the best this way.",37
353,In this eesay I will answer the question wether this should or should not be allowed.,37
354,This could cause problems as well.,37
355,"I think children just should not watch TV so often, so they wont see so many advertisings.",38
356,"On the other hand, it is not so good to be infront of the TV for little children and watching advertisment what will acctually happen if you allow advertisment for them.",38
357,"Children shouldn't watch television anyway, they should go out and play with other childen, so there isn't any problem with advertisings.",38
358,If the parents controlle that their children do not watch this kind of advertising it is not bad to let them watch television.,38
359,But in the other hand the parents could also give attention that their children do not watch the advertising in the TV or even do not let them watch TV anyway to be sure there is no problem with that.,38
360,"TV advertising could cause many troubles if it is abused and it could ""force"" the young children to sit in front of the TV the whole day.",38
361,In this case some people think if it could be bad for the kids to see all the advertises shown in TV.,38
362,"Furthermore there is not just advertising on the TV, there is advertising everywhere, so the children would not be protected against it, when it is stopped on the TV.",38
363,But my opinion is that we cant keep television advertising away from young children completly.,38
364,Not every television advertising is good for young children but they have to learn what's right and what's wrong.,38
365,Children are heaviliy influenced by everything they see.,39
366,Young children can be easiliy influenced by everything.,39
367,"And children can be strongly influenced by them, especially in a very young age.",39
368,ther the children also get influenced.,39
369,Children can also be influenced more easily by different things.,39
370,"This influences how the kids see themselves, how they think their life has to be.",39
371,There is a very big influence from the world around young children to their mind.,39
372,Children get influenced in so many ways.,39
373,The children are influences by a lot of things around them already.,39
374,"It influences not only their minds, but also their physical action.",39
375,"That view can cause conflicts between the children and the parents which can, in worst case, loose their control.",40
376,"My closing word: the parents have to decide what is best for their chidren, they are their responsebility.",40
377,The children can not dicide on their own want the want to do.,40
378,The parents should have the control.,40
379,"In my opinion, the parents have to decide what is good for their children.",40
380,Furthermore I think that the parents should be responsable enough to look after their children.,40
381,The parents should look by themselves what's good for their children and what not.,40
382,I think the parents of the children have to take care what their children see and of what kind of things they should be influenced.,40
383,In conclusion I have to say that I think it is up to the parents.,40
384,Then the parents should not force them to do anything they do not want to.,40
385,They grow up with television.,41
386,The grow up with the TV and are influenced by it.,41
387,Maybe they even get addicted to television and can do nothing else than watching tv when they are older.,41
388,But otherwise they can learn a lot in the television.,41
389,"When watching TV, they get into a world that made from adults for adults, and that may propably influence their innocent childhood negatively.",41
390,So they`re children believe the Television more than they`re own parents!,41
391,"The good thing is, that they can learn something from watching television.",41
392,Mostly they do not only watch series for the right age that leads to them watching television advertising.,41
393,Because when they get contact with the television they can easily get addicted to it.,41
394,What they see on television isn't how the real world works and it might give them wrong ideas.,41
395,Television advertising directet toward young children should not be allowed.,42
396,Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.,42
397,Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed.,42
398,Television advertising direced toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.,42
399,Television advertising direced toward young children(aged two to five) should not be allowed.,42
400,"All in all, television advertising for young children should not be allowed.",42
401,Television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed.,42
402,Television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.,42
403,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.,42
404,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.,42
405,In my opinion the advertisement should not be banned but somehow reduced.,43
406,"In my opinion, it wouldn't be correct to forbid to show such advertising.",43
407,My personal opinion is that we can`t and shouldn`t prohibit the advertisement because of two reasons.,43
408,"So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed.",43
409,In my opinion we should allow the advertisement but we should control it.,43
410,"In conclusion, it can be said that to forbid those advertisements would seem like a good idea at first sight, but it would just bring disatvantages.",43
411,So these advertisings don' make sense for me and I think that they shouldn't be allowed.,43
412,If the advertisements show bad things such as violence or things which are easy to understand they should not be allowed.,43
413,"In my opinion, the advertising should not be allowed anymore.",43
414,Some people want that those advertising should not be allowed.,43
415,Young children can't really think for themselves yet.,44
416,Young children often can not understand things like adults.,44
417,But young children can not control their brain as much as possible to know what is good and what is needed.,44
418,"On the other hand, children at this age actually can be influenced easier by things they see and they learn quicker from them.",44
419,"Kids in such a young age are in the middle of developing and learning things about the world, how to act, how to speak and so on.",44
420,"Children in that age can`t differencate what they are seeing, not like adult person.",44
421,"Children don't have the same abbility to overthink things and see behind what is being shown to them, as an adult does.",44
422,Children in the aged of two to five cant think about that like grown up can.,44
423,At that age not a single child has the conciousness and knowledge about themselves as much as we do at our age.,44
424,The brain of children in this age is not so developed like a brain of an youth or an adult.,44
425,Especially young children are depending on their parents.,45
426,Parents have to do a lot for their children.,45
427,The parents also play a big role in this subject.,45
428,That is part of the parents work.,45
429,"Not only can this result in high costs for the parents, but also in tears from the children when they don't get what they want.",45
430,And in a way they start to make the children depend on them.,45
431,So the parents are responsable to manage their kids and show them what they need and what they dont.,45
432,It is the parents job.,45
433,Furthermore I think that the parents should be responsable enough to look after their children.,45
434,On the other hand the parents are responsible for their children in nearly every situation of life.,45
435,I don't think you should stop children from seeing advertisment.,46
436,It is better for the whole society to forbidd advertisements for young children so they get better adults in the end and maybe change something in the world for good.,46
437,"However, if the advertisement shows things the children should not see it should not be allowed.",46
438,In my opinion advertising targeted towards young children is dangerous and should regularly be controlled by adults.,46
439,In my opinion the advertising which is directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.,46
440,Banning advertisement targeting young children probably would not solve the problem since they are also affected by those who have adults or youngsters as a target group.,46
441,Some people might say that directing adverts to children should be forbidden.,46
442,"At the first place, young children are not able to handle with advertising.",46
443,"So I think advertisement for children sould not be allowed, when it is affecting them in a negative way and sets them under a bad influence.",46
444,From my point of view advertisings that are directed to children should be allowed .,46
445,On the other hand it would be great for the economy.,47
446,"There are positive aspects, especially in economical terms.",47
447,On the other side the economy would gain less money.,47
448,"ThatÂ´s on the one hand of course an advantage for the economy, but itÂ´s not a good way to grow up.",47
449,So it is good for the economy.,47
450,The only people for whom it would be a good thing are companies because they can earn a lot of money and that could also be good for the enviroment of the countrie.,47
451,But on the other hand you could say that it's good for the economy.,47
452,"Although this could be mentioned as a part of the economic engine of esociety, it could cause problems.",47
453,An second argument is that it's good for the economics.,47
454,"Secondly, it is also well for the economics.",47
455,They start to terorrise their parents because of that.,48
456,Often the parents donÂ´t allow it what makes the children scream and cry if they are disappointed.,48
457,"For their parents, this can be very annoying.",48
458,Children need and want other things than adults.,48
459,The parents often suffer of that and calm the child.,48
460,Such behavior can distress the parents.,48
461,It's true that the children often gets angry if they don't get what they want.,48
462,"Children don't have the same abbility to overthink things and see behind what is being shown to them, as an adult does.",48
463,the kids also do dot know what they see and they do not know what they want.,48
464,But what the parents olny recognise too late ist that by a behaviour like this the kid will only get spoiled.,48

541,"Nowadays, many children spend a lot of their time watching TV and are exposed to television advertising towards them.",56
542,Young children also watch television which is why they get confrontated with the advertising too.,56
543,Not every television advertising is good for young children but they have to learn what's right and what's wrong.,56
544,"By directing television advertising toward young children, the kids get connected to the advertinsing and market world by this young age and are not able to develop their own mind and own opinion.",56
545,Television advertising plays a big role in our life.,57
546,Television advertising is something we see a lot when we watch TV.,57
547,Television advertising is a very big theme in our society today.,57
548,Television advertising has a big role in modern society.,57
549,In today's society advertising is a big part of television.,57

552,Television advertising is a very common topic in daily life.,57
553,Television advertising is common in today's society.,57
554,In television there is a lot of advertising.,57
555,"Additionally, those advertisments often show, that one might be more included into the society, or in specific peers, when one  chooses to buy this product, which again makes them eager to this product.",58
556,They see all these nice things the product can do and then thay want that product.,58
557,They try to stimulate our feelings so we might feel in need of the product being advertised and tend to buy it.,58
558,They also can bring the consumers to think they really have to buy this products.,58
559,So they buy the product.,58
560,The way many commercals work is that they try to convince people why their product is extraordinary.,58
561,They aim to get people to buy a sepcific product.,58
562,With this knowledge that they developed over the years they think about if they actually should buy the product when they see it in an advert.,58
563,"But when they see new products in the advertisements, they are interested and they want to experience the feeling of having this new product.",58
564,"Actually every advertising has this aim, to make people to want have a product.",58
565,Furthermore companies know that children are easy to manipulate and so they are more interested in convincing children to buy their product than honestly explaining their product and it strenghts.,59
566,"Even if the children want to buy a product they saw in an advertising, there are the parents who decide if the child can have the product or not.",59
567,"On the other point of view the advertising directed toward them influences the children to much, so that they want this product, and maybe get some anger with the parents, if they don't want that the children get this product.",59

571,"The companies actually manipulate the children because especially the younger ones, aged two to five, can't decide whether it is something they really need or if it was simply shown in an advertisement.",59
572,"For sure, children are manipulated by exciting advertisements and are used to make their parents buy these products, but if parents are upset with that, they shouldn't allow their child to be manipulated.",59

594,I remember the happiness i've felt when my father gave me his phone for a minute or when my parents said that I can watch a movie that's longer than forty-five minutes.,62
595,"I remembered that I was that kind of child, that always stood up early in the morning and watched some cartoons.",62
596,It is better when they play outside with their parents or other young children in their age.,63
597,They should play with other children and explore their surrounding.,63
598,They should play outside and socialize.,63
599,Instead they should play with other kids outside and learn to share and communicate with them.,63
600,They should play outside with their friends and family.,63
601,They should play outside and meet friends and play with them.,63
602,They should play outside or play with teir family.,63
603,Young children will also go more outside and play with there friends games like hide and seek or football.,63
604,"Children should go outside, play with friends and have fun.",63
605,Kids should go out and play with other children.,63
606,You have to allowed your children to watch TV.,64
607,"A child sees that and bother his parents so long, until he or she has this toy.",65
608,The child might want to own the toy and will constantly beg the parents to buy the toy.,65
609,"First, children are very naÃ¯ve and mostly want to have the ""coolest"" toys.",65
610,"This costs a lot of money for the parents and if the parents say: "" No, you wonÂ´t get this toy. """,65
611,"Every child wants the newest and coolest toys and keeps nagging their parents to buy it for them, and so most of them do.",65
612,"If the parents are annoyed enough, they will buy it the toy.",65
613,"When they grow up with it and make many memories with these toys they may buy it for their own children, when the are grown-ups.",65
614,The kids know every new toy so it gets difficult for the parents to show their kid something that it doesn`t know yet.,65
615,So the Problem is that the children see these adorable Toys and like every other child they want to have them.,65
616,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",65
617,I think television should be allowed to show advertising.,66
618,Back to the question: it should be allowed to show advertising on television.,66
619,In my oppinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed.,66
620,If television advertising should not be allowed there would be so many things which had to be not allowed too.,66
621,It's my opinion that television advertising should be forbidden,66
622,First of all television advertising isn't something you can allow or not.,66
623,"Advertising Television should not be forbidden, but maybe it would be better, if parents would only let there children watch television about an hour a week.",66
624,In my opinion televison advertising should not be allowed.,66
625,Should the television advertising not be allowed?,66
626,In my opinion television advertising should not be allowed at all.,66
627,"I dont think that they are going to understand a lot by watching these adverts, because they aren't ready to go on with what they see at this age.",67
628,They are too young for understanding what's behind the adverts,67
629,These advertising would influence them too much because they are too young to understand what an advertisement is for and how it is not always realistic.,67
630,"Another point is, that children in this young age can not understand the advertising completely and they want to have all of it, if their parents would allow this.",67
631,On the one hand children that young get an insight into the adult world with such advertisents.,67
632,Children the young age of two to five often do not even understand the adverts and most of the parents do not buy random stuff for their kids just because it showed up on television one time.,67
633,They are too young to know if they want to watch the advertising or not.,67
634,Even more important for me is that these young children are not consumers yet and don't make their own decisions about what to buy or not - and I think that their parents are not that much interested in these kind of adverts.,67
635,Thats the reason why advertising is too effectible for children at these ages.,67
636,"First of all, young children are influenced by advertising more than older ones.",67
637,"
Advertisements are found found everywhere in our daily life.",68

642,Advertisements are becoming more and more present in our daily lifes.,68
643,Every day we are confronted with advertising of some sort.,68
644,"Nowadays, advertisements are everywhere.",68
645,"In our every day lives, we are confronted with advertisements probably more than we are aware of.",68
646,In our life we get confronted with a lot of advertising in all regions of our life.,68
647,Should it not be allowed?,69

649,"In my opinion, it should not be allowed.",69
