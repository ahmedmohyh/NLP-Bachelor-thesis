0,This is the problem in that case.,0
1,But also that is a problem.,0
2,And this is the way I see it a gigantic problem.,0
3,But it can also lead to other problems.,0
4,So this can not be the solution.,0
5,That is the main problem in this topic.,0
6,So this could be a problem.,0
7,On the other hand this really should not be a problem.,0
8,This could cause problems as well.,0
9,But this could also lead to a problem.,0
10,"But then, nobody would see the products and buy it.",1
11,So they will loose a lot of money in the future because they just buy what they want.,1
12,They will not understand why something is neccesary and why they need it because in the ads everything is shown as it is necessery in life and you have to buy it to be able to continue to life a normal life.,1
13,"But if they start to buy one thing, they will have to buy a sencend thing and so on.",1
14,It could become a much bigger issue than just wanting to buy some stuff.,1
15,So they have choice to dont buy.,1
16,"In the end it's their choice to buy new stuff, and it's also thei fault.",1
17,"So then, children would want every new toy they see on TV because it looks cool, but of course their parents won't buy them every item.",1
18,In the end they have to decide whether to buy something or not.,1
19,"On the other hand there will be parents, which won't allow their children to buy anything.",1
20,First of all television advertising isn't something you can allow or not.,2
21,In my opinion the advertisement should not be banned but somehow reduced.,2
22,"In my opinion, it wouldn't be correct to forbid to show such advertising.",2
23,My personal opinion is that we can`t and shouldn`t prohibit the advertisement because of two reasons.,2
24,If the advertisements show bad things such as violence or things which are easy to understand they should not be allowed.,2
25,In my opinion we should allow the advertisement but we should control it.,2
26,"So all in all i say, that some kinds of advertisment should be not allowed.",2
27,"In my opinion, the advertising should not be allowed anymore.",2
28,"If the advertising would be prohibited, many people would be mad and would be against it.",2
29,There are different opinions about what kinds of advertising should be allowed and at what point it should be banned.,2
30,Those advertising can influence their mind and how they will think and act later.,3
31,"Besides, some advertisments are made for another group of people, for example teenagers or adults, so it has a bad influence on them.",3
32,"Oftentimes we do not even take notice of the advertisement itself and the message it enforces on us, yet we are all subconciously influenced by it in our choices.",3
33,Advertising is trying to convince the watcher.,3
34,"On the other side, they maybe learn early that the advertisment is something to look at critcal because there are different strathegies to manipulate the people.",3
35,They don't realize that all those advertisements are made from huge companys which want to earn as much money as possible.,3
36,But sadly most advertisements are very manipulative and in conclusion should not be directed towards people who are not able to decide for themselves or think rationally about what their,3
37,Some people may think that television advertisement is something  bad.,3
38,They think that the advertising is telling the truth.,3
39,"Maybe they don't understand what advertisement is, but they see things they would like to have.",3
40,On the one hand children of the age two to five shouldnt be watching too much TV anyways as it isnt ideal for their age group.,4
41,"Second of all, in my opinion, children aren't supposed to watch TV at all, exept for some films a month or rarely some PokÃ©mon or similar series.",4
42,This is more a parental point of view: kids should not spend too much time in front of the TV.,4
43,"Of course the children shouldn't spend too much time in front of a TV, but that's the thing parents should be keeping an eye on normally.",4
44,"All in all, I think it is the own problem of the parents if they let watching their children tv in such a young age.",4
45,I think a child of the age two to five shouldn't be wathcing a lot of television anyways.,4
46,You often hear that young children (aged two to five) are using so much television because the parents watch so much TV or the parents haven`t got any time for their own children.,4
47,On the other hand side shouldn't children such a young age be watching television often anyways.,4
48,"So in my view the young children in the age of two to five should not watch TV they should do other (importanter) things in their life, which they only can do in the young life to play outside with friends and something like this.",4
49,"I think, children generally shouldn't watch television a lot.",4
50,"When young children watch television it's most of the time movies or series specifically made for children, with toys, animals or something to learn.",5
51,"Sometimes young children watch television because they like episodes, which are specially made for children.",5
52,Nowadays not only teenagers and adults watch television but also children from two to five years old.,5
53,"I mean there are a lot of series only for young children and this series say, that the children will learn something with the television.",5
54,Many young children now a days watch a lot of televison.,5
55,"Today, there are many television programs which are directed to young children.",5
56,"Not every show in the television is made for children, but they`re watching it.",5
57,Children watch televison quite frequently nowadays to get attention and be entertained.,5
58,"Obviously, the children are confronted with lots of information but because of them being so young it often doesn't matter what they are watching.",5
59,"First of all, why should a child in the age between two and five sit in front of the television and watch this kind of children shows?",5
60,On the other hand those advertisments are mostly shown on channels which are also for young people and what if they would just show advertisments for grown-ups on those channels?,6
61,But sometines those advertisings are especially made for young children.,6
62,"The most of the advertisements are made for adults, and not for young children.",6
63,Some advertising are directed for adults and some are directetd toward young children.,6
64,The majority of these advertisements is directed to older people for example to their parents but there are also advertisements directed to young children too.,6
65,On the one hand children that young get an insight into the adult world with such advertisents.,6
66,There are advertisements just directed toward children at young age because these innocent children are easier to influence and direct than a grown adult.,6
67,"If there wouldn't be advertisement directed toward young children, the children would just see the advertisement directed to adults instead and that maybe is even worse for them, then seeing the advertisement especially produced for them.",6
68,"Television advertising isn't only directed towards teenagers, young adults and adults in general but towards young children as well.",6
69,"Furthermore I do not think it is really effective either to actually direct the advertisments toward children, seeing how they actually do not sit in front of the television at that age.",6

80,"Children are very naive and they don't see the problem behind advertising, they simply believe everything, especially in the age from 2 to 5.",8
81,The companies creating those advertisement definentely see the potential of manipulating a child into wanting something it doesn`t need.,8
82,Young children are growing up with these advertising and not often are these advertising made for them.,8
83,Children the young age of two to five often do not even understand the adverts and most of the parents do not buy random stuff for their kids just because it showed up on television one time.,8
84,"Children are easier manipulated by advertising than adults, for they don't realise that advertising tries to manipulate them.",8
85,"Kids at the age from 2 years to 5 years do not really have the understanding to realize, what the advertising shows.",8
86,"On the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life, so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products.",8
87,Children have a blank mind and they got influenced quite strong by those advertisements.,8
88,Just because the children cannot yet analyse and think through the advertisement.,8
89,In addition even if there are negative aspects in the advertising the children are not influenced very much because the brain does not remember very much when it is so young.,8
90,"Additionally, the child possibly enjoys those advertisings since watching those funny advertisings becomes more exciting than actually playing with the toys.",9
91,"These advertisments often make kids want the toys, or worse, make them want to be like the people in the advertisment.",9
92,"Often the advertisment shows new toys, the children want immediately because they are so easy to influence and sometimes don't even know what the advertisments are.",9
93,They often like advertisements to discover new toys and there are as well advertisements which support the education of the children.,9
94,The purpose of these adverts is to awaken the interest in these children for asking their mommy or daddy to buy them these toys.,9
95,"If the kids see an advertising, they think that they couldn't live anymore without having this toy.",9
96,"Even if the ad just introduces new toys or games, children will get attracted to it and will certainly want to buy them due to the lack of rational decision skills.",9
97,"On TV shows especially made for children, there are lots of ads which show new toys that seem often very appealing to them.",9
98,"But these advertisings also manipulate the children a bit, because on these advertisings only a few things are shown and they are shown in that way, that the kids think ist the best toy ever, and the toys are often diffrent, than in the advertising.",9
99,"Whether it is the newest Nerf dart gun or a Hot Wheels toy car track, the same children's adverts are broadcast time and time again on various channels in an attempt to persuade children to persuade their parents to buy a certain product.",9
100,Not every television advertising is good for young children but they have to learn what's right and what's wrong.,10
101,Young children also watch television which is why they get confrontated with the advertising too.,10
102,"But children do not only watch the TV shows, but also the advertising inbetween.",10
103,"Nowadays, many children spend a lot of their time watching TV and are exposed to television advertising towards them.",10
104,Children do also watch television and there are advertisments directed towards them.,10
105,Television advertising directed toward young children is not perfect but the advertising is just a part of watching television.,10
106,"Television advertising directed toward young children

Advertisements are a big part of our life.",10
107,"Children shouldn't watch television anyway, they should go out and play with other childen, so there isn't any problem with advertisings.",10
108,"Too much advertising is confusing children, they have to quit watching TV sometimes to discover new things in their lives, without general, good and bad, influence from television advertising.",10
109,Television advertising is using young childrens naivity.,10
110,A big part of today's television is advertisement.,11
111,In television there is a lot of advertising.,11
112,Television advertising is something we see a lot when we watch TV.,11
113,Television advertising plays a big role in our life.,11

130,For children it is very important that they do not grow up with only smartphones and i pads and co. For them it is also very important to play outside or with playmobil or lego.,13
131,On the one hand kids and parents can learn about new toys that come out.,13
132,However a lot of children have already enough things to play with and they don't need more new things.,13
133,"Furthermore young children have the oppertunity to play with friends, with their parents or with toys and everybody knows that children have lots of toys.",13
134,"But under this age I thing that the chidren don't really know what this is and what is good, also are toys not everything for these young children.So it have positiv and neagtiv arguments.",13
135,There aren't only good toys that the children can use.,13
136,The kids know every new toy so it gets difficult for the parents to show their kid something that it doesn`t know yet.,13
137,Those children may be disappointed once they recieve their new toy or game.,13
138,"Nowadays children are used to electronic items like computers, televisions etc.",13
139,Otherwise it is not good to show children what toys they must have to be cool or something.,13
140,If childrens see something they want parents often have to give in and go buy it for them.,14
141,The problem of this is that often young children just want everything and they can't decide what really is worth to buy and then the parents will buy it for their children to not disapoint them.,14
142,"When they see something they like, they will not stop asking their parents to buy it, until the parents give in and fullfill their wish.The problem is that children this young do not know what is necessary to have and what is not.",14
143,When they now go to their parents and insist on getting that knew doll or the new lego set young children can be very complicating.,14
144,But if the parents do not buy the stuff the children can get very angry an ennoying.,14
145,They may want to buy more and more and won't accept if the parents won't buy them the things shown in the advertisements.,14
146,"If their child wants something, they will know that and then they can decide, if they want to buy that or not.",14
147,But for the parents this is really anoying because the childrens always want them to buy what they want and some of them just stop if they have what they want.,14
148,"Most of the time, the parents won`t buy them the toys they want.",14
149,"Parents often don't like this, because they want to decide what they want to buy them.",14
150,Now i want to show some arguments for and against this and in the end summarize my opinion.,15
151,In the following agrees and disagrees of this topic will be showed.,15
152,"In conclusion, there are many different opinions about this subject and not a simple solution.",15
153,"I will explain some pros and cons to the statement, which was given us above.",15
154,In the following text I show my opinion about this topic and present my arguments.,15
155,In the following I will present my opinion on this topic.,15
156,"There are not only positive arguements, but also negative aspects.",15
157,There are pro and contra arguments which will be laid out.,15
158,Of course there are many different opinions for this topic and IÂ´m going to present some.,15
159,In my essay I will discuss exactly this statement.,15
160,"A big point against the advertising is, that children get influenced by advertisings and even more if they're young.",16
161,"Furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see, so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children.",16
162,"Moreover, children can't really react on the advertisings, because they don't have money to buy something by themselves so the goal of an advertising isn't reached anyway.",16
163,"Advertising is like manipulation and should not have an affect on children, especially not on young children.",16
164,If kids see advertising for children they could not know that advertising is often just for making money for the companies and often what they promise in the adverstising is unreal.,16
165,"At the first place, young children are not able to handle with advertising.",16
166,"First, the advertising isn't good for children, because it influences them.",16
167,"Studies show how the mind can be subconciously influenced by advertising and to make such advertisements for children is a rather dangerous thing, because the brain of a child is yet to be fully developed.",16
168,"In conclusion, these advertisings give the children a false view of things, they increase problem between parent and child, and sometimes, they just confuse them.",16
169,Young childrens could miss understand the meaning of the advertising and get influenced by them.,16
170,"
Advertisements are found found everywhere in our daily life.",17
171,We are confronted with advertisement everywhere our everyday life.,17
172,"Nowadays, advertisements are everywhere.",17
173,In todays life advertisements are everywhere.,17
174,Advertising can be seen in all places in our everyday life.,17
175,Advertisment is everywhere in our daily lifes.,17
176,"Nowadays advertising is to be found everywhere, no matter if you are in a Cinema or if you read the daily newspaper.",17
177,Every day we are confronted with advertising of some sort.,17
178,In our daily life we are confronted with advertising nearly every single minute.,17
179,In our society there are advertisements everywhere.,17

190,That can be negative for the development of the children.,19
191,Some people think that this could have a bad influence to young children between two and five years old.,19
192,But this can have negative influences on the young children.,19
193,What bad influence can it have for the young children?,19
194,This could cause that children try things they`re not made for.,19
195,On the other side it can have positive afffection to the children.,19
196,It could have bad issues to the creativity of the child.,19
197,It has also a high possiblity of influencing children negatively.,19
198,This gives the children a very wrong image of the world and might cause depression or other disabilities.,19
199,Some people think that it can have a bad effect on young children.,19
200,"We live in a consume time, where it`s important to have many different and new things.",20
201,We are living in a world where technology is a very important thing and many people can't live without.,20
202,Especially when one considers the technologies one have to face in our computerised world.,20
203,We are living in a world where technology affects our daily life and where we are dependent on it.,20
204,"Nowadays the world is full of modern techniques, smartphones or computers which make everything easier the people think.",20
205,"We are in the 21. century, so technology is a huge part of our life.",20
206,"is an often discussed statement in this time, bacause the media with television, computer and smartphones is more present then ever.",20
207,Also the situation we have today with all the social networks.,20
208,This is a part of living in this generation.,20
209,We live in a world where the people have to accept the developement of new things and this will also be an important thing for the future.,20
210,"Many companies
have commercial tactics that help them to sell more products.",21
211,And companies need to sell they're product aswell and advertings them is a pretty good way.,21
212,So they buy the product.,21
213,They also can bring the consumers to think they really have to buy this products.,21
214,Companies need it to get people to buy their products.,21
215,Companies are promoting their products in the best way they can to sell it.,21
216,Every company tries to get their product to the group of people who could be interested the most in buying these things.,21
217,This point makes it seemingly obvious that it is no good idea reffering to the specific companies sake to waste so much money in order to influence persons which are not even able to buy something on their own but do not give in such an easy way and think about it a bit more.,21
218,It's a strategy to get the consumer used to its products and gain profit.,21
219,Otherwise big companies live from selling thigs and they want to sell as many products as possible.,21
220,In conclusion I think that unless you are a person who does not care about children you shouldn't allow advertising directed to young children.,22
221,I dont think advertising toward young children should be completely forbidden.,22
222,My opinion is that there should be advertising directed toward young children.,22
223,"In my opinion there should not be any advertisements dirceted toward young children, because parents can't completely controll it.",22
224,All in all I don't think advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.,22
225,In my opinion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because children are way to easy to manipulate in their age.,22
226,In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed.,22
227,In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldnÂ´t be allowed.,22
228,For those reasons i think that advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.,22
229,"So in my opinion advertising for young children is not really a big problem, because there are enough possibilities for the parents to make sure that they do not get influenced by that.",22
230,In my opinion it should not be allowed.,23
231,"In my opinion, it should not be allowed.",23
232,In my opinon it can be allowed but it is useless.,23
233,In the following text I will explain why it should and should not be allowed.,23
234,"However, I do not see a good reason why it should not be allowed since it does not badly affect anyone.",23
235,"I think, that it should not  be allowed.",23
236,In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed.,23
237,"My opinion is, that it should be not allowed.",23
238,"In my opinion, it shouldn't be allowed.",23
239,In my opinoin it should not be prohibited.,23
240,And if they see something they want it.,24
241,They have expierience and can decide if they want to spend their money on this product or not.,24
242,They see something and then they want it.,24
243,"But when they see something they particualery like, they want to have it.",24
244,"They see something new and so they want it, no matter if they need it or not.",24
245,"They do not think, if they could need it, they just want it or not.",24
246,Because when they get everything they want their whole childhood they learn that this is normal.,24
247,"They see something and if they like it, they want it.",24
248,Their minds can't get off that thought that they want to have this toy for example.,24
249,Because they see too many things they do not really need.,24
250,"In this young age, children learn very much and get influenced by many things in their life.",25
251,"And if they learn something in their young age, they keep it sometimes until they are grown up.",25
252,In this age childrens try to learn from thinks around them.,25
253,"On one hand, children see new things, know what's existing through othre sources than only their parents and maybe the kindergarden.",25
254,If they don't learn that early they may have problems with it later.,25
255,Children can learn from a very young age to know which things are on the marcet and to think about what they really need.,25
256,They have to get some things teached befor they are ready for this world and they have to get a certain amount of maturity.,25
257,"On the other hand, children at this age actually can be influenced easier by things they see and they learn quicker from them.",25
258,Children learn the most things when they are still very young.,25
259,In the very first years of a child the kids learn from seeing what is in there world aroud.,25

287,Already young children want to know things about them and want to use them.,28
288,"If Children often watch TV, they will maybe lear how the technology works.",28
289,Like that the advertise helps the kids to think by themself.,28
290,So it isnÂ´t a problem that young children watch television advertisings.,29
291,Television advertising isn't dangerous for the childrens.,29
292,So in my opinion there is no need to not allow television advertising for young children.,29
293,Thats why it is not necessary to forbid the television advertising directed toward young children.,29
294,In my opinion there is no need to not allow television advertising toward young children.,29
295,I donÂ´t think itÂ´s necessary to not allow television advertising directed toward young children.,29
296,"In my opinion, there is no need to forbid television advertising directed towards young children.",29
297,But there are also reasons which show that there is no problem in showing young children television advertising.,29
298,So it is not necessaire to ban television advertising directed toward young children.,29
299,So I don't see any reason of give a forbition of TV-advertising for childrens.,29
300,It's difficult to recognize if their children could have fun with this toy.,30
301,Also the children will annoy there parents because they want a lot of things that the don't need.,31
302,On the one side the children could have a problem with the parents because it thinks that they never get what they want.,31
303,"The Children might even get unhappy because their parents can not afford what they want, and the Children don't understand why their parents don't buy them what they want because they don't understand the use of money.",31
304,"Additionaly, the children are practiclly born into a world of consumption and this will take their innocence and childhood away.",31
305,"So the parents would have many problems, if they maybe have not enough money.",31
306,This leads to the little kids becoming materialistic at such a young age.,31
307,"That view can cause conflicts between the children and the parents which can, in worst case, loose their control.",31
308,"In the end, the parents should teach their children from early on, that they can't have everything they want to.",31
309,Because of that the children might want something very useless and the parents who want to do their children a favour give in an buy a lot of unnecessary stuff.,31
310,Children need and want other things than adults.,31
311,But when they are adults they have to earn their own money before buying something new.,32
312,Secondly children havenÂ´t money on their own.,32
313,"This can bring problems when they become teenagers: they don't get much pocket money or the don't gain much money in a job and if they get it, they spend it immediatly, often on things they see on television.",32
314,"When they are grown up, they have to be aware of that and they have to know how to manage money.",32
315,- Children don't know the value of money.,32
316,"They don't think so much about money and how usefull something is, as adults.",32
317,They are young and do not understand that everything costs money and that money has to be earned.,32
318,"So the process of learning how to spend money wisely is much more difficult, especially if their parents never take the initiative toteach them properly.",32
319,The childrean don't think much about the money which their parents are spending for them.,32
320,But on the other hand these children have not the money to buy the products they want and so they need their parents money (And until the age of five I got no pocket money).,32
321,Television is a big part in our daily lives.,33
322,Nowadays lots of people watch television.,33
323,"In the time of today, television plays a big role in the daily life of most of the people around the world.",33
324,Television is a big topic in our society nowadays.,33
325,In our society television playes a remarkable role in many peoples lifes.,33
326,"Nowadays, television has become to a need of todays society.",33
327,Watching television has become part of our daily life.,33
328,In our modern society we often watch television.,33
329,"Television is a part of our daily life, we watch it to relax, for entertaining reasons, to informate us, what happen around the globe.",33
330,In our todays life the television is a big part of our world.,33
331,"A child sees that and bother his parents so long, until he or she has this toy.",34
332,"But when the mother refuses to buy the toy, the child gets mad and sad.",34
333,"This means that the next time the child mentioned is in a store with its parents, it will definitely want the new toy.",34
334,Now the child just sees the fabulous design of the thing and wants it immediatly.,34
335,Even though the child gets the toy it doesn't has a perfect life as the child in the television who has a lot of fun with his new toy.,34
336,"Days later they maybe want their mom to buy this delicious chocolate snack or the talking doll, which the advertising showed in the best possible way to impress children.",34
337,After that the child goes to his mom and ask her to buy this figur.,34
338,Everytime your kids watches TV it will see all these fantastic toys and everytime it will come running to you afterwards and beg you for one of them.,34
339,"And finally, the child would want the toy but the parents could not afford it so child would get sad.",34
340,"So when this toddler goes shopping with one of its parents, it will definitely point at it's memorized and now recognized toy and will start demanding for it.",34
341,Many companies try the advertise their products towards the young children to make more profit.,35
342,Furthermore companies know that children are easy to manipulate and so they are more interested in convincing children to buy their product than honestly explaining their product and it strenghts.,35
343,The companies try to influence the children to buy their products and to be a customer who only buys their products.,35
344,"Even if the children want to buy a product they saw in an advertising, there are the parents who decide if the child can have the product or not.",35
345,Brands use young children to sell their products.,35
346,"Because there is a authority wich can decide wether to buy a product or not, the influence on the young children does hardly matter.",35
347,"On the other point of view the advertising directed toward them influences the children to much, so that they want this product, and maybe get some anger with the parents, if they don't want that the children get this product.",35
348,"Children should be just children and not manipulated by advertising, I think.",35
349,"On one hand, the advertising is important for many entreprises who make their money from young children products.",35
350,"Actually, the advertising for products which are concepted for these young children is not for these young children, it's for their parents.",35
351,Nowadays young children spend a lot of time watching television.,36
352,Young children tend to spend more and more time in front of the television in this day and age.,36
353,Nowdays a lot of young children watch television.,36
354,TOday alot of young children watch a lot of TV.,36
355,Watching television is nowadays a very big part of a childrens life.,36
356,Nowadays most of the younger children in our society are growing up with televisions surrounding and entertaining them.,36
357,Nowadays watching television is part of the everyday life of children.,36
358,Nowadays millions of children are watching television every day.,36
359,Children frequently watch TV already in a young age.,36
360,Nowadays lots of young children are watching television.,36
361,If the children want something then sometimes the parents buy it because of the advertisements.,37
362,"Even if the children want to buy a product they saw in an advertising, there are the parents who decide if the child can have the product or not.",37
363,"Furthermore, the parents can have a really hard time convincing the young children not to buy something, when they have seen it on television and think it would be cool to have it.",37
364,But if the parents do not buy the stuff the children can get very angry an ennoying.,37
365,The parents know better than the children what is right and what is wrong and wonÂ´t buy the things from the advertising if they are not worth it.,37
366,"If their child wants something, they will know that and then they can decide, if they want to buy that or not.",37
367,As already said children want to buy the things they see in the advertising and do a lot to get them.,37
368,"Companies use this situation to sell their products, because they know that parents will buy the product their children want.",37
369,"I mean even if a child wants a product which was advertised in TV, the parents are in the end the ones who buy it.",37
370,"In addition, parents are often not able to say ""no"" and eventually buy the certain product.",37
371,"My closing word: the parents have to decide what is best for their chidren, they are their responsebility.",38
372,The thing is; the parents have to know what they want for their children.,38
373,The parents should have the control.,38
374,It is in the responsibility of the parents.,38
375,"However, again, this is in control of the parents.",38
376,But this is the responsibility of the parents.,38
377,Their parents have to say what is good for their children.,38
378,It is up to the parents.,38
379,Its in the responsibility from the parents.,38
380,In conclusion I have to say that I think it is up to the parents.,38
381,What they see on television isn't how the real world works and it might give them wrong ideas.,39
382,"If they watch television advertising directed 
to them, they  may form theirselves a wrong opinion abo",39
383,So they are influenced by everything they see in television.,39
384,So everything presented on television could influence them hence they have not learned yet not to believe in everything that is told on TV.,39
385,So if the television tells them to like that or do this is has a such a big effect on them because they do not know yet what the main things in the world are.,39
386,Their minds are not fully developed and are easy to influence.,39
387,"And in this age they learn everything, what they been told, so they take it how it is and i think they can't decide if this in the TV is reality.",39
388,Television advertising makes them believe that and it has a big influence on them.,39
389,They try to copy things around them and because of that they are greatly manipulated by such messages.,39
390,On top of that they do not reconize when they are influenced.,39
391,Television advertising directed towards young children is rarely harmful since most children aged two to five don`t watch TV the same way adults do.,40
392,Not every television advertising is good for young children but they have to learn what's right and what's wrong.,40
393,Not every television advertising is bad for young children.,40
394,To put it in a nutshell i think that there are pretty much opinions for the advertising directed to young children and today it might be usual that young children watch tv not like twenty years ago when everyone want to go out and play football or something and furthermore it is propably not the best idea to connect the advertising to young children because they should not get addicted from tv that fast.,40
395,"In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children, as they are manipulative and create a world which does not exist.",40
396,Television advertising directed toward young children is not perfect but the advertising is just a part of watching television.,40
397,"In my opinion, young children should not be exposed to television advertising as if mind corrupt their innocent minds with inapporiate content.",40
398,"To sum up, television advertising shouldn`t be allowed for young children, because they are influenced too much by them.",40
399,"To put it briefly, television advertising can be dangerous for children since they cannot decide what is good or bad for them.",40
400,"I think television advertising toward young children isn't a good thing, because the children aren't old enough to understand the things in the TV, they just watch it.",40
401,They should go outside and play with other kids.,41
402,They should play outside and meet friends and play with them.,41
403,"They should go outside, play with friends and have fun.",41
404,They should rather play outside with some friends and explore the world.,41
405,They should play outside with their friends and family.,41
406,They should be more outside and play there something with theire friends.,41
407,Their childhood would be better if they'd go outside and play with friends.,41
408,Instead they should play with other kids outside and learn to share and communicate with them.,41
409,They should go outside and play with their friends or someting like that.,41
410,Instead they should be playing somwhere outside in the garden with their friends or exploring the nature.,41
411,I think the parents of the children have to have an eye on their children and what they are watching.,42
412,They now that the children could influence their parnts quite much.,42
413,First I want to say that the parents have to watch their children.,42
414,"Moreover, it could also be disturbing for the parents of the children.",42
415,This would lead to serious problem when the children become teenagers or adults.,42
416,I think the parents of the children have to take care what their children see and of what kind of things they should be influenced.,42
417,We have to think about that these children that we are talkking about are in a very early period of their lifes.,42
418,But if their parents tell them they do not need this maybe the children will understand and everything is fine.,42
419,Children need and want other things than adults.,42
420,The children can not dicide on their own want the want to do.,42
421,Young children are very easily influenced: Their brain is still in the beginning process of development.,43
422,"First of all, young children are easily influenced.",43
423,"Children don't have the same abbility to overthink things and see behind what is being shown to them, as an adult does.",43
424,Young children can be influenced easily.,43
425,Young children can be influenced easily.,43
426,"As already mentioned above, children are very easily influenced.",43
427,In their youngest years children can be manipulated and influenced very easily.,43
428,Young children can be easily be influenced and they change their opinion rapidly.,43
429,Children are heaviliy influenced by everything they see.,43
430,Firstly I think that young children are very easily influenced by things.,43
431,It is better when they play outside with their parents or other young children in their age.,44
432,Young children will also go more outside and play with there friends games like hide and seek or football.,44
433,They should play with other children and explore their surrounding.,44
434,"Children should go outside, play with friends and have fun.",44
435,Young children should better use their spare time to play outdoor and together with other kids.,44
436,"In my opinion, children should play outside in the garden or in the nature with friends and should not watch tv the whole day or play games on a smartphone.",44
437,I think it is very important for a children to play outside or searching friends.,44
438,"Young children should play with things, with friends, go out in the nature etc.",44
439,I think the kids should play outside than sitting inside and watching TV or playing with a smartphone.,44
440,They should play outside and socialize.,44
441,"Every child wants the newest and coolest toys and keeps nagging their parents to buy it for them, and so most of them do.",45
442,Because if the children see all these great toys they want to have it for sure.,45
443,"These children see them and then, they want all of the toys and harrass their parents to buy them.",45
444,"First, children are very naÃ¯ve and mostly want to have the ""coolest"" toys.",45
445,When the children often watch television and see a lot of the advertise they want all of the beautiful toys.,45
446,"Obviously when they see all that new kind of toy which seem to better than the toy they already have, they ask their partents to buy them a new one.",45
447,But of course they just do it because they know that nowadays children lose interets in a toy much faster and then they'll go back to the couch and keep watching television and see another cool thing they want really badly.,45
448,So the Problem is that the children see these adorable Toys and like every other child they want to have them.,45
449,"Children want to have the toy and will be mad about their parents, if they do not get the product.",45
450,"We all know that they master the art of seducing their parents to get what they want while walking down the aisle of the toy store, so if the saw that fun new toy on television earlier, they will more likely try to get this toy with which they are already familiar.",45
451,Furthermore the child can learn about moral and friendship.,46
452,Also young children can learn.,46
453,It could help the children to learn.,46
454,The young childrens can learn a lot of things.,46
455,"It is important to show them the life in different kind of ways, how they could learn to communicate or to talk or how to behave while being with other people.",46
456,The young children have to build their own future and it would be helpfull if they get to know our world in their young ages.,46
457,The children are open minded and if you show them in their early years a childrenfriendly Sierie they maybe could learn something.,46
458,Parents think it can also help to improve the knowledge of theire kids.,46
459,Childrens want to learn about the world.,46
460,So that the childern can learn a lot of things in this young ages.,46
461,"Then the parents could forbid to watching television for the childrens or not, it's their own opinion.",47
462,"But when the parents take the TV for shows, who have bad follows for the kids, it should not be allowed.",47
463,If parents are against this they should be able to forbid to much television in general.,47
464,So I think it's up to the parents to make sure their children only get to watch what is appropriate for them instead of not allowing television advertising.,47
465,I think you have to chose if you want that your children watching television or not.,47
466,One site I agree with this statement but at the otherside I think we can't forbit children watching televison.,47
467,Besides the parents should protect that children so that the parents decide when the children are watching television.,47
468,"Young Children should not watch too much television anyways, so the parents have to control what their children watch.",47
469,"The decision if children should watch TV or not should be a thing of the parents, they know what's the best for their children.",47
470,"Secondly the children should not be depandent of televion in such an young age, because sooner or later it will happen anyway!",47
471,Advertising plays quite an important role in our society.,48
472,Advertising becomes more and more important in our world.,48
473,Advertising is a part of our life and comtrolls our decisions.,48
474,Advertisings in general do occupy a big aspect in our daily lifes.,48
475,Advertising is very important for selling products.,48
476,Advertising is something that we are confronted with every day of our lifes.,48
477,Advertising can be seen in all places in our everyday life.,48
478,"First of all, it has to be said that advertises are really important in our daily life.",48
479,Today advertising is part of our everyday life.,48
480,In the modern world advertising becomes more and more important.,48
481,Things like this can leads into a big social trouble with other humans.,49
482,This can be good and bad.,49
483,in this way it is not a bad thing.,49
484,It does not need to be only a bad thing.,49
485,"But when they see this too much, it can",49
486,But is that really a bad thing?,49
487,It can cause a few troubles.,49
488,This is whatÂ´s dangerous.,49
489,"This does not only apply to adults, but to children as well.",49
490,Because of this it could happen bad things.,49
