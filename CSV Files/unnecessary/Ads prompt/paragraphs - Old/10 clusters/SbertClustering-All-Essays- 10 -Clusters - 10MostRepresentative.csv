0,"Since children, especially aged two to five don't have any buying force on their own it's their parents decision whether a purchase is made or not. Advertisement directed at a very young target group therefore does not have an impact on childrens prosperity. They aren't able to amass any debt and therefore the only thing the industry is taking advantage of is the parents soft spot. The children will automatically run up to their parents and beg them to buy the advertised product which only be bad for the parents nerves.",0
1,"Young children can be manipulated very easy, when they see something that looks nice, or toys which other children play with they want to have it. They believe everything which is showed in television. Such young children should't be influenced by advertisments. It is bad for the children if they are faced with all the advertisment, it can influence their learning and growing up process badly. Young children can't buy things themself so the adverisment shouldn't be directed towards them. The advertising should influence the parents through their kids. It tells young children to ask their parents to buy them things, this can influence the children-parent connection.",0
2,"If young children should be the target of advertisments is a very crucial and debatable topic. People that are against it tend to say that already at an very young age children get influenced by big advertisment companies. The children can often be easily manipulated and the resulsts are that the parents need to spend money on products that the children mostly don't need and the joy won't even last for long, cause these children same as the adults will fall for newer and better products when they come out and they won't be able to have enough and wil never stop craving for bigger, better and newer products. children shouldn't be influenced and manipulated at this very young age, they should be playing outside, socialize and being educated and not a consumer victim at the age of 5. By not knowing what exactly it means to buy, spend money and own a product those children that are targeted will get a bad understanding of earning, owning and buying. On the other hand we live in a consumer world where our needs get mostly fullfilled by products which is debatable if it's good but thats how we work. So shouldn't those children be confronted with the true World at an young age the learn how to live with it. They could develop skills and a feeling at an very young age what advertisments really are and getting a better understandning of products and advertisments. In a faster grwoing world it seems logical that children should be confronted with the ups and downs and start to learn about them and how to  live with them. Nevertheless children should be allowed to be children to play learn and have fun and not being influenced by big companies at the age of four. What those companies do is brainwashing by using nice colors, sounds and children to play in the commercials. At this young age the Children don't have an understanding of what they're watching and that what they're watching should make them buy stuff. Because of this and many other reasons I highly discourage the advertisment of young children aged two to five.",0
3,"Brands use young children to sell their products. Children from age two to five are a good target,as their are innocent and it's easy to sell them something. As long as the advertisement is held in bright colours with some pop music, the children will pay attention to it. Children will see a new toy in television once, and they will think about it all the time. In the first place, the advert reaches the child in front of the television, but indirectly it is also sold to the parents, grand-parents, aunts etc. who are willing buy it. In the best case, someone will buy the desired toy and the advertisement fulfilled its purpose.   ",0
4,"First of all, it is very easy to manipulate the opinion of a child in that age. The advertisment could manipulate them and interfere with their raising. Kids a these ages dont know what advertismend is an could easely think, that everything in the advertisement is true, so that when they get the produkt they are sad that it is not as good as in the advertisement.
Also Kids should not get familiar with big companies to soon. Our world is all about companies and names these days and we should not raise our children in a way that supports this.
Children could also form grops and exclude those, that cant afford or dont like the toys in the advertisement.",0
5,I agree with this following statement. Because I see that the young children are vicitims from elder people who want only power over the children. Those advertising can influence their mind and how they will think and act later. Maybe the advertising is furious and scary. I also think that a young child doesn't need a advertising for chose his toys or dolls.,0
6,"First of all you can say that children aged between two and fived do not have that complex progress of will like we do as adults or young adults. They see the advertisement, like the toys that are pictured and with the next episode of Spongebob it is no longer interesting for them. Additional to that the children are not the ones who can buy these products in the normal stores because in the most cases they will only go shopping with their parents.
But actually advertisment that is driectly directed to the children can somehow influence them in their future consumer behaviour. The advertisemnt and the way the parents treat their childrens wishes could optimise or make their former consumer behaviour even worse. If a kid gets everything it wants, it will possibly buy everything it wants as an adult too and gets selfish. Additional to that there is some kind of social pressure. The parents of the children, who are directly confronted with the wishes of their children, probably can not afford the toys. The comparism kids do about toys puts a thirtend social pressure on the parents and could also be an indicator of wealth in society. The advertisement made for children is also kind of dangerous because children can be teached wrong moral rules or they can not estimate the symbolism or clishees the advertisement often uses.",0
7,"Young children don't really know what it means to buy something, they don't even know what money is.
When they see something in the televison, they want to have it, becaus the people who are using it are very happy. Children can't think of the future as we can (e.g. when the toy is broken or when they are too old for it). Money isn't important to them and they can't imagine what a specific price conectet with a product means, wether it's a fair price or not. They aren't able to connect all those things togheter.
Young children aren't allowed to buy things by themselves, so advertising directed towards them shouldn't be allowed. The parents have to buy all the things for them and they have to decide what they want to buy, not their children. Parents have to do a lot for their children. The last thing they want is an annoying son or daughter who wants someting unnecessary and expensive.
A reason against this statement would be that the people who make those television advertising have to pay a lot of money for that and that they somehow have to earn money with their business. It's a good strategy to advertise directly toward young children, because they are easy to convince and nobody can say ""no"" to such a cute little person.",0
8,"Nowadays there are many companies which advertise their products over the television. Many of those are advertisements about shampoos or a new parfume or something like that. A new trend which came up, is to advertise products toward young children. Most of them are toys. 
To tell whether it's  bad or good to do this kind of advertisement we have to list the pros and the cons.
One thing which would be in favour of the advertisements is that children get to know which products there are. They can tell their parents that they would like to have that new toy which they saw in the television. That would be a way how parents wouldn't waste money on things their children don't even want. Instead of buying their kid something that will never be used, they can make their child happy. 
Now that we talked about the pros, let's talk about the cons.
Many of the products advertised in the television are either useless or over-priced. The ""manipulate"" the children so that their parents will buy them the new toy. 99% of the time it's only about making money. The companies make their advertisements as cool as possible so that many children go to their parents and tell them that they want the product. It's hard for parents to say no to young children. They don't want the kid to be sad or to think that they're bad parents so they eventually just buy it. 
Children of this age can't decide whether they need this new toy or not. They see the advertisement in the television and decide upon that if they want it or not. Young kids don't ask themself if they will play with it more than once or twice. The part of their brain which is responsible for the critical thinking is not as developed as the brain of an adult. 
After talking about the pros and cons i would like to tell you about my own opinion.
In my opinion advertising toward young children is another way for companies to make money off of young children. I do think that it shouldn't be allowed since it either has as a result that kids are mad at their parents or that parents have to waste their money even if they're living from hand to mouth. Many young couples which have young children don't have that much money to buy their kids every expensive toy they see on the television. It doesn't really have a good side for the parents. The problem is that economie doesn't work like that. Money is all that it is about.",0
9,"In conclusion it can be clearly said that the advertising tries to influence the young children to make them dependent to their products. This is not good at all because we all are being influenced by something we don't want to, which is sort of doing harm to someone. The young children can't do anything against this process and in my opinion this is where also the profit-organized businesses should stop.",0

20,"Many parents said that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. There are many reasons which are supporting these statement. It could be helpful for young children if television advertising should not be allowed. In the following, I will explain my point of view.
However, television advertising is an entertainment for everyone, it does not matter which age you are. It is mostly better than sitting around and be bored. But there is also an other important point. Young children could use television advertising to learn something.
There are not only positive arguements, but also negative aspects.
First, television advertising is mostly unhealthy for young children. For example they can get very sick and they cannot get any friends if they are television advertising. But there is also an other arguement which do not support the statement. Children have to make expiriences in the world, and television advertising do not bring any important expiriences. 
At last, television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. The health of young children is too important and television advertising could be like a wall between the children and the society.

21,"In the following text i will comment the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.                                     
First I give you some points to disagree with this statement. Most of the children aged two to five will watch tv everyday so it does not matter if they are watching advertising made for them or not. Furthermore it is even better that they have advertising for them instead of watching some durex advertising or something because that might hurt their brains more than the new Winnie Pooh Bear or something else.
Otherwise it is not really positive to show the children that much television because they should do something outside and not watching tv the whole time. So the children allready watch that much tv that they should not also have some advertising which might addict them to buy something or saying their parents that they need to have this otherwise they will be bored for sure or something like this. So it should not be the aim of the parents to let their children watch tv the whole day and if there is advertising not directed to them they will have not that much interesst to watch tv so they do not watch that much tv automaticly.
To put it in a nutshell i think that there are pretty much opinions for the advertising directed to young children and today it might be usual that young children watch tv not like twenty years ago when everyone want to go out and play football or something and furthermore it is propably not the best idea to connect the advertising to young children because they should not get addicted from tv that fast. They should still have the chance to have a nice growing up without that much tv and playing outside or something, of course the time has changed and without electronic hardware there is no life but in the young ages you do not need this to have fun.",2
22,"Television advertising directed toward young children is a controversial topic. Some people think it is okay at the age of two to five, other people think it should not be allowed. In the following text I will give reasons for and against it and tell you my opinion about this.
One reason for that advertising could be that children get in contact with the medium at a young age. Like in today's world they grow up with such ""influence"". A reason against it, which is mentioned often, is that children, especially young children, will become numb because of the huge influence that the TV and, not only but surely, advertising have. Another reason against it is that the parents of the child should have the control over what they buy for it. Of course they should look at the wishes of their child. On the other hand there are things being advertised which are not suitable for a child and these wishes should not be accepted. A reason for the early advertising could be that the children can specialise themselves on what they like and what they do not like.
All in all I think there should be this form of advertising. It does not harm the children. In addition the parents need to have the control over what their children are watching. Not when they are older but at this young age.    ",2
23,"Television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed. I really agree with this statement and I will show you the reasons in the following text.
A boy watch television and after every thirty minutes there comes different advertising for ten minutes. The young boy ,who is just two to five years old see the advertising and that ist not very good. At first he will be influenced with five years or lower. That could be very bad for his following future. For example: He watchs very often TV and because of that he realize all the new products, which he always want to buy. 
The advertising for young children is very attractive for them, because there they show the young children new ""Barbies"" or anything else. The hypothalamus, the most important thing of the head, of the children is not completly produced. So they can not devide between the advertising that is good for them and the advertising that should manipulate them. 
Arguments against the advertising toward children are in the following text. A young child, aged two to five, should not watch television. And if they don't watch television they won't be influenced. So in my opinion the parents should have a look on their children and control they media life of their child.
The reason of advertising is that it should make the people buy these things in the supermarket for much money. ",2
24,"Some people think that television advertising directed toward young childeren should not be allowed. They say that advertising for children aged two to five leads to a more developed TV programme for kids and thus also a higher risk for television addiction. If a child for example watches TV where there are lots of brakes with boring advertising for adults, children will be more likely to stop watching TV. But if there are lots of advertisements which kids are interessted in, they won't get bored as fast so they'll keep on watching TV. The opponents of television advertising for young children are concerned about more children spending their time watching TV instead of playing outside which is important for the developement for a kid. These people also fear that children will get more unhappy through advertisment. They think that it is very important especially for little kids to learn to be happy with what they have rather than to experience a lack of consumption goods.
Others say that television advertising improves a child's developement. They think that it's better for  children to see TV advertisments for their age than adult advertisements. These people also say that child advertisement will lead to a better economy because more kids beg their parents to buy them the products and toys that they had seen in TV.
In my opinion television advertisement for children should be prohibited. I think that it is important for children to learn to be happy with what they have than to experience a lack of something. I also encourage kids to play than watching TV and I am afraid that television advertisment for kids will lead them to get more used to watching TV.",2
25,"In the following essay I want to point out my opinion towards television advertising addressed to young children.
Almost every household has an televison in the 21st century. Advertising is getting more popular because it is an easy way to influence the society. The impact of advertising is a controversial topic in our community.
Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed because children are not able to understand the impact of most of the products. Some of them could be harmful and children would get addicted to things which are not good for their development. On the other side even young children have the same rights than parents. They are all potential buyers in the future and ,well, watching advertisment doesnt imply buying this product. Maybe this specific advertisment helps young children to find out what they are going to wish for their birthday. First of all I have a general question. Are young children aged between 2 and 4 interested in watching television? I donÂ´t think so. On the other hand it is proofed that advertisement influences a buyerÂ´s decision. At an age of 3 children should not be confronted with advertisment because they should better go out and play with their freinds. It is also morally questionable when companies try to benefit from children. If advertisement directed towards young children would be allowed young parents who alredy got a low budget had to explain their children that they are not able to buy this product. This disappointment is not good for a young character.
If this kind of advertisemnt should be allowed we would definately need a law and an nutral institution that controlls this law. How sould it be possible for this institution to decide wheater this product is directed towards children at an age of 5? It is just logical that companies would say that their product is made for people at an age of 6 but it can also be used by younger children.
Overall I thing that television advertisement directed towards young chiildren shouldnÂ´t be allowed becuase of the mentioned facts.",2
26,"A controversal topic nowadays is television advertising. Some people think, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed. In the following I will comment on that topic. 
Firstly you can say, that these advertisments, towards young chilren, offer the producer a bigger frame of costumers. Often advertisments are directed towards adults or teens, so that they buy certain products, but also if an advertisment does not catch an adults or teens attention, a young child can influence their parents to be interested in that special product, so that they look at it again.
Furthermore especially young children are easy to influence and so they believe everything said in the advertisment. They do not have as many life experience as their older siblings or parents and so they believe especially people, who seem trustful, alot and when it is a good advertisment they can get influenced by it very much.
Young children at the age from two to five should not be allowed to watch television or television advertesments. In the age of two to five they should play outside with friends. They should not sit inside and watch television alot, perhaps in the evenings, the children program, but there are no advertisments in these special shows for young children.Television advertisement can influence their personalities in wanting everything. Young children, who watch much television or television advertisments can get badly influenced by these, because they often tell you, that you should definitly buy the product and so their character can get influenced in wanting everything.
To sum it all up, I would say, that these television advertisments towards young children should not be allowed, in the reason, that it could influience their life in a bad way, and noone wants that for their child.",2
27,"In the following text I will discuss the question, if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not. This is a topic many people disuss and it is not easy to say if it should be allowed or not. There are many points that have to be discussed, to make a decision about it.
One argument to allow the television advertising directed towards young children is that these children feel part of the society, otherwise it could be that children do not feel involved. On the other side it could be kind of manipulation to direct television advertising towards children. There are too young to deside on their own if an advertising or the product in it, is good or not. That could be also an argument for television advertising directed towards children. Maybe they could learn to deside on their own with this advertising. For sure it would be better when parents could help their children in another way to learn how to make decisions. 
Another argument for showing advertising directly to kids is that it could be boring for children when they see advertising for adults only. 
There are more arguments to show advertising to children directly, but the only real good argument is that it could be to boring for children to only watch advertisments for adults. But anyway I will agree to this statement, because IÂ´m sure there are way more better activities for children from two to five than to watch television and the advertisments.",2
28,"Television advertising is certainly one of the most effective ways of advertising. But children don't know how to deal with them and they can't really estimate what the advertisement says. In this essay I will try to answer the question if it should be allowed to advertise towards young children.
Many young children wath television and if they watch  television they automaticaly watch television advertisememnts. Television advertisements are often presented like the product is the best thing that exists. If you don't know that tricky way of presentig a product, you think I must have that thing and if you have this attitude once you won't ever see the negative things of it again. You can't really teach a child that advertisements exagerate a lot when they present a product, they won't really believe you if they've once seen the advertisements. Young children also often can persuade their parents very well.
For the company this must be a good way of advertising products, because they can make a lot of money with it. If you watch it from the parents perspective it isn't very nice because you have to tell your kids again and again that they can't have that toy and the child thinks that the parents don't like him anymore.
I think a child of the age two to five shouldn't be wathcing a lot of television anyways. If he does nevertheless it should be also a part of the teaching of the child to show him how to deal with advertisements. They should learn that advertisements don't really show the real things and they can't just have anything they want. I think this problem is also  because of our luxury standards. If we wouldn'thave televisions we wouldn't have this problem. All in all I think you can't just forbid it because fr the companies it's a way of making money.",2
29,"
Advertises are often shown in the TV. They adress all ages even really young children. And that might be a problem as many criticers say. 
Young children are easily influencable by television advertising. So they might build themselves wrong values which stay their whole lives in their head and behaviour. 
On the other hand we could say that it is part of the parentÂ´s job to decide if and what their children watch in the TV, to give them the right values. 
Another point might be that children aged two to five are not interested in advertises and even if they are they have no opportunity to get what they want without their parents. So the parents can control their children nevertheless. 
And every child has to learn that not everything what is said in the TV is good and that they can not get anything what they want. This is a really important process in the life of a child and the understanding is easier when it starts as early as possible. 
So I would say that television advertising toward young children should not be forbidden but the parents might know that they have to control the TV activity of their children.",2
30,"When discussing about whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not you can choose between two different points of view. There are several arguments that speak for and against it. 
Nowadays, young children are already watching television. Their parents prefer to let them be entertained in front of the television instead of raising them up properly. Obviously, the children are confronted with lots of information but because of them being so young it often doesn't matter what they are watching. They can't distinguish nor memorise the information they receive from the television. On the other hand, allowing children to watch television advertisiments may lead to damage in the long-term as they start requesting the advertised products.
In addition to this, a young child may not even be capable of thinking on its own yet. It may not link the idea of seeing a product on an advertisement and the idea of going to the store to buy it. Also, children aren't even capable of going to the store on their own, so advertising for young children on television may really just be a waste of money. In comparison, one could also say that in the long-term young children may really feel the urge of buying advertised products as they were introduced to advertising very early in their life.
In conclusion, I want to mention that, in my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be prohibited because it probably doesn't affect the children in the long-term. I would even go so far as calling it a waste of money because it won't be the children who buy the products but their parents.",3
31,"There are TV channels which are in particular for children and surely they also have advertising. In the following I will discuss, if television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
First of all one can say that there are already some channels which have no advertising anymore, for example the KIKA channel in Germany. 
Now I will come to my first pro argument which is that the firms want to make money though. They have to show their toys or stuff like that to the children, otherwise maybe nobody will buy it, beacuse parents do not watch children TV shows. 
Secondly advertising causes no real harm, the children wont get a psychological disease, if they see advertising once in a while.
In opposition to that I want to mention some arguments against the advertising. 
Firstly advertising is boring, especially for children, which is not alawys bad, because maybe consequently they switch the TV off and go playing outside.
Furthermore advertising influences the children in a certain direction, much more than adults or adolescents. The reason for that is that children have no idea that advertising is made up by firms with actors, so that it is a ""lie"". They only see happy children playing with a new toy and out of this reason they want to have it, too. Most times theses things are unnessesary and quite expensive, so the parents do not want to buy it. This will make both parties sad, the children as well as the parents. 
If it is the case that the child gets what it wants, it wont have fun with it forever,the child will see a new advertising and desires a new item. This could becomne a kind of circle.
To conclude I would say that even though advertisings for young children cause no real harm, it should be not allowed, because it bores the children and it causes an unhappy family situation. Beyond this I would admit that in my opinion watching TV is not good for children at all, however playing with friends oder outside is a better alternative. Sometimes an ad might be appropriate, but there cannot be so much of it or even hidden advertising in shows, which children are not able to discover.",3
32,"Watching Television is quite normal in our modern world. Almost everybody does it and many love it. But many people hate advertisements. They destroy the whole scenerie of a good film we are watching an most likely show things we really do not need. But especially young kids watch TV these days and they get overrun with advertisements concipated just for them.
The statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."" is a really controverse topic which is often discussed. 
This is a very difficult question if this should be allowed or ist should not and I think there are many arguments that support this these but also some against it. In the following text I will discuss at least a few of them. 
One argument that is against the statement is that many companies would not sell any products for children they produce if they would not advertise it in the TV. Children in this age do not go into a shopping mall and buy their stuff at it. They tell her parents what they want to have and most likely they see it on the TV, the advertisements are one of the few ways for companies to sell their products. 
An argument that supports the these is that really young children are easy to manipulate and that might happen if they watch advertisements on the TV. They do not have an own opinion and they witch it really fast an support everything that is shown to them. Especially ads that directly go towards the children is really dangerous in this case. They can get manipulated so they could support things which are bad for themselves for example.
Another good example for the advertisements is that they could do the complete opposite of the argument I just mentioned. They could inform the children or teach them some things they need for the future. The advertising would be used for a good cause so to say.
TV advertising could cause many troubles if it is abused and it could ""force"" the young children to sit in front of the TV the whole day. They would not do anything else. Another point is that some kids would be angry if they do not get the things they wanted to get. This could be horrible for the parents who have to deal with the children after this.
In my opinion the advertisements in TV should stop. Especially for young children. This power is abused too often for example with manipulating the children. They get a totally wrong ""picture"" of the world and the other people and might be forced to sit in front of the TV the whole day just because of the advertisements they watched and still watch. The arguments that count for advertisements in TV are far too small. They could never get bigger than the arguments that support the statement.",3
33,"Many people have different oppinions on whether television advertising directed toward young children who are aged two to five should or should not be allowed.
Nowadays there are many children who watch television even the really young one's who aren't even old enough to understand everything that is happening. 
That is why they probably don't really understand the television advertising which is why it isn't dangerous when it's directed toward them. The young children can only understand everything through their vision.
When parents see the advertising which often is about some kind of toy that every children wants to have they could take that as an idea for a birthday present or something like that which would be an advantage of the advertising.
But there are often children who act in this kind of advertising who are just as young as the children that are watching these advertisings which is a thing that in my oppinion should be talked about as well. Children who aren't old enough to decide whether they want to act or not could be used by their parents for money which would be considered as child work. The problem is that if this had to be forbidden it should be forbidden for every kind of television which means that they also could'nt act in movies or television shows and then again the movies would become rather boring. 
All in all there is no reason for me why television advertising should not be allowed apart from the fact that the children who act in the advertisings are too young to make that decision themselve because often enough the young children don't even understand what is happening in there.",3
34,"In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of several reasons. First of all, children are not a part of the adult community yet and do not earn any money. It is the responsibiltiy of the parent to decide what is good for their child and what they want to buy for it. Therefore the advertising should be focused on parents and not on to children. 
Secondly, children are easily influenced, which makes it a lot easier for advertisment companies to get into the children's heads. That fact brings a certain danger, some people could misuse that opportunity to influence children in a bad way. And it could also be a reason for a quality drop in television advertising.
I also think that children should spend more time in nature playing, making social contacts and making a lot of experiences out there in the world. It might be alright to watch television from time to time, but if the advertisement encourages children to play with some product and make them believe that they actually need it to be happy it makes them addicted to things, which could kill off children's natural eagerness to live and play.
Having too many things or products also dicreases the children's creativity, since they do not have to come up with any own ideas to play anymore. This would lead to serious problem when the children become teenagers or adults. They would always have to rely on products to entertain them.
All in all, television advertising targeting children seems to be a very bad idea to me. It does not focuse on the buyer but on the user of the product, which does not make sense because the parent is responsible for their child and should decide what they play with. It has also a high possiblity of influencing children negatively. Other points are that it discourgages the children to make any experiences in the real world and it decreases a children's natural creativity.",3
35,"Television advertising is seen by everyone daily. Companies are advertising their products and special offers. Adults know how to deal with advertising but we were asking ourselves the question if television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. 
Advertising made for young kids is usually about toys or cartoons. It's made colorful with lots of big impressing pictures which is why kids think it's interesting to watch. If there is an advertising about a brand new toy the children always want to have it so they go to their parents and ask them to buy it. The kids are too young to understand that people always want to sell their products and kids are the best way to do this because parents usually can't say no to their young kids. They also don't understand that all of these toys cost a lot of money. Nevertheless children at the age of two to five don't understand most of what's said in advertisings which is why I think that it doesn't really matter if companies use advertisings or not especially because they won't be able to remember it the very next day. 
In my opinion television advertising for young children are very tricky because kids with their positive minds believe everything and they get impressed easily. So I think a few advertisings can be allowed if they are made carefully. But there shouldn't be as much ads as for adults so the kids can focus on their cartoon without beeing interrupted by multiple advertising. Also parents should try to explain to their kid that they can't have everything that's advertised, I think it's important for kids to know that.",3
36,"In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children, as they are manipulative and create a world which does not exist. On top of that these young kids get introduced to a society of consumption which is n't good",3
37,"I agree with the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. At this age children are easy to influence. They donÂ´t have the ability to decide wether something is right or wrong.
By influencing the children, the parents get influenced as well, because the children talk their parents into buying things. By directing television advertising toward young children, the kids get connected to the advertinsing and market world by this young age and are not able to develop their own mind and own opinion. They have an opinion on whats right or wrong and whatÂ´s good to buy planted in their minds.",3
38,"Im my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Because television advertising can be informative for something the children wants, and the parents shouldn't allow everything when his children wants something.
 
Not every television advertising is bad for young children. If there is a advertising about a special toy, why should that be forbitten for children? It is clear that the parents aren't happy when their child wants everything what they see in the television advertising. But they can learn something about it and the parents know what is fancy and what not.
Another point is that the parents should decide what the children are watching in the TV. And if there is something what the children want, the parents shouldn't allow everything. They should say no and must be consequent. ",3
39,"The statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"" is a very controversy but actual theme.
I definitely think it should not be allowed to show little children advertisements. Firstly because they see it often enough in public or here it on the radio. Secondly because advertisement on television is so much more deep and figurative because of the possibility of filming, picture mmaterial, special affects connected with sound, lightning, colouring and camera movings. 
These huge ammount of information and pictures in such a short time is too much for little children's brains and could lead to headache or other physical and even psychical problems. 
Another thing is how you could seperate advertisement for grown ups and for children. Nobody knows which television programms children watch and nobody knows during wich time of the day. So it would be dramatic if a little child sees advertising for or against war, beer or cigarrets. Like I said earlier children going to see these things soon enough so they should not be confronted with this in an even more accurate way on television as well.
Advertising often leads to depressions or self-harming, anxiety or eating disorders for many boys and girls (aged ten to more or less open end)according to several studies. People start to compare themself or their life with others. Actually they compare with advertisement whichdefinitely does not show real life and is always faked in many points. But advertising seems to be real especially on television so people dont see how unusual and unnatural it is. 
This is a never ending circle because people will always find new things to compare with, new trends are going to show up, advertising will change and companies produce new ones fitting to the newest trends.
Bacuse of that it is important to safe children from these wrong pictures and impressions about how life is which they get from advertising. It is more important to show and teach them the real things that matter in life or even little aspects for example what a strawberry is and how it real and natural taste is. The children of today are getting so fast old and behave or have to behave like teenagers or grown ups that it is very important to let them be little children as long as they can. ",3
40,"First of all it is important to make a distance between normal stuff on TV an series which are made especially for young children. Some parents thnk that those shows arenÂ´t good for their children because it is just some dump content or unimportant facts. 
But others think it is good for children to wach TV because they can learn things for their life or they get someone to look up to except their parents.
It is important to included that there are also different kinds of shows for children. Some are made directly for teaching and others are just made for entertainment. 
Some critics say that parents should use the childhood and even the early childhood of their children to do something as a family. For example to play outside or visit a zoo but the TV is not good for children because they would learn from nonexisting characters what life is about.
Others say that it is a good posibility for parents who have to work alot because they can keep an eye on their children but they have the time for their job too.
To take a look at the topic from another position the television is good for young children because it is another way to teach them how to speak or how to name different things. 
When children wch TV they have got the chance to talk to their friends about it and maybe their parents can use it to introduce them into the daily life.",4
41,"Furthermore young children have the oppertunity to play with friends, with their parents or with toys and everybody knows that children have lots of toys. So they can use their time better than to watch television. They must learn to play with their self and probably they also msut learn to be ennoyed.",4
42,"Many people think that television isn't really good for young children. Some think that what young children hear or see on TV can be understood wrongly by them or can influence their actions and thoughts. For example when there is an ad for sweets, a child in that age just thinks: ""I want that."" This is because children in that age aren't thinking as reasonable as children in a higher age already do. A child has to learn to know the results of their actions. ",4
43,"On the other side young children should go out and play with other childs, instead of sitting along in front of the tv. The children should be outside and have fun. There are to many dumb series in the television, which doesn't have any avantage for the childs. One example is Sponge Bob. 
Parents should look for their childs and make little advantures with them. The family can go to a museum of dragons, a hike through the mountains, and the childs will have a really good day with a lot of memories. In opposite, a child won't have good memories of a day iin front of the tv. ",4
44,"People these days cannot live without electronic machinines. Almost in evey household theres more than one computer and TV. The children grow up with a televiosion, which is on the whole day. But television advertising directed toward young children should definetly not be alllowd. 
One reason is, watching television the whole day, makes you stupid. You are not using your brain anymore and you lose important skills. The brain cannot develop anymore. They are only focused on watching and their brain has no work anymore. In this stage of age it`s absolutly important to learn things. Listening, speaking, physicaly and psychology things. Only if the parents support creativity etc. the children can grow up to an intelligent adult.
Not every show in the television is made for children, but they`re watching it. Sometimes the televionsion shows things, which are definetly not good for the psychologycal developtment. The tv shows us movies full of violence, wars or horror and in this way they can scare the kids. Scaring instead of caring is always not a god solution while growing up.
Relationships get lost, because of watching too much tv. A lot of parents aren`t interested in spending time with their kids. They are always buisy, have work to do or just not in the mood for playing with their children. Instead of caring about their kids, they let them watching tv all the time and this is definetly not the idea of having children.
The problem today is, that many parents have no creativity anymore and because of that the tv is on during the whole day. But this can have negative influences on the young children. We should forbit television advertising directed toward young children, just to save their future.",4
45,"Children often donÂ´t know what to do. So parnets put them infront of a TV. But is this really the right thing to do when your kid is between aged two to five? If the parents have many things they have to do and the child is only annoying then it is a good thing to show the kid a serie. It is not okay to think that your child is annoying but that is a different subject. Through TV- shows kids can learn many things, e.g. colours but also cultural normes like sharing to other peoeple or that it isnÂ´t okay to hurt somebody. There are also some shows where kids can learn other languages. But on the other side scientists found out that kids could get ill from watching TV. Young children can only see many many pictures which changes very quickly. They couldnÂ´t realize what happens and canÂ´t understand what a TV is. Also there is a lack of communication when children watch too early too much TV. They canÂ´t say what they feel or want because they have less words to use. And in general it is better to care about the children. When parents decide to have a baby then they have to spent time with her/him, even if it is a difficult situation. Kids learn a lot when for example the parents read them something out. They know how to listen and how to learn by heart. I think it is okay for young children to watch TV once a week but only for half an hour and only if the kid wants it. The shows must be checked by parents if it is a reaaly good one and donÂ´t get the children be stupid (like the Teletabbies). But there are many other activities to do. The kid has to learn how to do something alone when he has nothing to do, TV arenÂ´t allowed to be the answer. He has to get a social life even it is a young person. Otherwise they donÂ´t learn how to share in real life or all those cultural normes. So I would more agree with the statement that Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed. ",4
46,"First, we have to think of the great knowledge that these young children could get from watching interesting documetarys. Parents often think that everything what their children are watching on tv is bad. But thats not right because there are many good series for little children which prepare them for their life. Of course the parents must have a look for the tv when their children watching something. It is right that there is very much bullshit too. And it's important that little children don't watch some bad scenes because it could make them ill. An another important fact is that children shouldn't watch tv for too long time otherwise they don't want to play outside anymore or something else. But it's okay if the Ã½ watch daily for one lesson and than their parents have time to relax. But today, there are too many young children in front of a tv everyday for a too long time. This is not even healthy anymore and they loose their connection to the real life. That's a big problem for many familys in our century because their childs life very unhealthy.",4
47,Television nowdays is full of advertising and it isn't something special if you have full 10 minutes of dumb short-films. But these little short-films dont influence young children. And if you raise your child the right way they wont just sit in front of the Tv because they will use their ability to think about new activities to spend the time outside.,4
48,"Television adverting directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
More and more parents of young children let their children watching tv, but other parents and people think that it isn't good to let children use electronics. 
When parents of young children have to do housework or have guests it's easy to set their kids in front of the tv. The kids are happy and the pparents can do other stuff. It's clear that watching tv not has to be only bad for the kids. There are special programs for baby's and children on the tv. In these programs the children can learn other languages, call animals by the name, learn objects or probably also how they have to (re-)act with other kids, parents and strangers.The brain of a child that sometimes watch tv probably could be more trained as the brain of a child that never watches tv. On the other side it doesn't make sense to have children and just set them in front of the tv, because they don't want to spend time with their own blood and it's also not that good for the eyes of the kids to see too long ond often in the screen of the television. Children should play in the garden or in a park with other people and parents. It's important to learn in real life, because in the age of one two five the children make experiences which are a lifetime with them. What the children see in the tv is not bad at all. Some things they learned by watching are a good help to interact for example in situations as in the park. They can repeat in real life what they've seen in the television. 
I with a dood mix of both is important for learning to ",4
49,"There ara some reasons why you would show or not show the television programm to achild aged two to five. One of those pro arguments is that it is very easy to entertain a child with the television because there is something going on all the time and entertaining such a little child can sometimes be very exhausting and parents dont have infinit power to do that, the TV is also good at keeping a kid calm, wich is very exhausting too, so it doesent cry and shout all the time.
the same thing if the parents are working and have a babysitter for theire child. but there are some intelligent programms too wich tell good maners or how to deal with complicate situations in live. A contra argument is that if children, especially as young as those we're talking about, don't get enough time and love from theire parents it can effect theire ""evolution"". Also if children don't go out to play with other kids they don't learn how to deal with other humans or kid of theire age somethig else is that if they don't move enough it may decrese theire motoric skills so that tey are worse in sports than other children. An other one is that if they always get entertained by a TV they don't learn how to entertain themselves an may get less creative. 
I think it shouldn't be forbiden, it's the responsebility of the parents but they should know how to use television if there is a young child.",4
50,"On the other hand this advertisings can have a big inluence on the children. Young kids aged two to five can hardly denie the feeling of wanting something. If they see an attractive toy, they want to have it and they will tell heir parents to buy it. Of course then it's the parents job if they'll buy the toy ore not, but the kids will learn this procedure of seeing a toy on TV and telling their parents to buy it, so they will sort of learn that they can have something just by watching TV and not buy for example accomplishing something.",5
51,"But there is an other side aswell. By bringing small children in contact with television advertisements these kids will form such a strong mind that they for example laugh about other children if they don't have the newest doll or the newest shirt. This can then lead to bullying as soon as the kids get older. 
After having seen these advertisements these kids won't be able to form their own mind on what they like and what they don't like, they think because they saw this object in an advertisement it for sure has to be the best. With advertisements precisely directed towards these kids they will have even more reasons on why to watch television. Advertising something for children young aged will make it very hard for parents to explain to their children why they can't have everything they want. These kids will want to have everything they have seen on TV and think that it is normal to have this particular object.",5
52,"In the society of today, children are getting confronted with new technology without much choice of there parents or even themselves. Technology is all around us, it helps us in our everyday life, it entertains us after a hard day of work and as such it is no wonder that most households are in possesion of a TV nowadays. This contributes to the media consumption of young children as they will be watching TV when their parents are doing so. Many companies have realised this fact and because of that, they saw television as a possible means of advertising. Most television channels are getting financed by advertising, so they are grateful to companies who will pay them to advertise their products. Television advertising is based on the time of the day to appeal to the audience who is sitting infront of the TV and as such, advertising targeted at children will mostly be seen in the late afternoon and early evening. Children look at the world in a different way than us adolecents and adults and that's why it's only natural that they have another understanding of advertisements than us. For a kid, possesions are a very big deal, so they are an easier target. If a kid sees a toy in a television ad, it won't think of the price or if there really is any use in buying it. A kid will just be excited and start to ask his parents to buy it for them. The parents, thinking a lot more rationally, will probably try to explain to their kid why they can't buy a new toy, they may not have enough money or they may not want to spoil the child. For a kid, those reasons mean nothing to them and as such, it won't be able to understand it. Instead, the kid will get angry at his parents and conflicts between them could come up.
That is why I think television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. Young children do not yet know what it means to have concerns about money or being spoilt, they can't control their greed yet, which means they'll fall prey to the fun advertisements of companies, promising them joy in buying their product, and small children won't understand their parents and instead get angry at them all over an ad on TV.",5
53,"Children are very easy to influence. By showing them food, toys and other things that they like but do not already have, the chance is high that they try to persuade their parents of buying it for them. Furthermore, television for children is made to show them different stories and characters with which they can identify. Television advertising interrupts these stories and movies children are watching and with that, their concentration towards the story or storyboard. Showing the children more and more of toys that they do not even need, makes them addicted to it and has brainwash potential.
On the other hand, advertising is always on television, wether it is directed to children or not. In this case it would not be wrong to direct advertising especially to children instead of adults, it is even more interesting for them. Advertising can not only be found on television but all over the place. In many cases it is important to have the skills of reading to understand the meaning, which children of five years do not already have. With television advertising that includes the written and spoken words as well as pictures of the product, let's say of a barbie, children start to compare the letters and the voice and try to understand it. Through that, reading and auditive understanding are improved. The other advantage is clearly made for the toy and movie industry, which produces the products treated in the advertising spots. The consume-behaviour of children is totally different than the one of their parents. Children at an age of five can not really consider wether they need something very bad or not. If they have success with convincing their parents of buying the things they want, the industry can make a big success out of it.",5
54,"Many young children watch TV on a daily basis. Mostly they do not only watch series for the right age that leads to them watching television advertising. 
Of course,advertising is not bad in general but it could lead to arguments within the family. For example because the children want their parents to buy a new toy that they saw in the TV. The parents could easily get annoyed if their kid always asks for new thiongs to try. And as all of us know, advertising often does not promote the truth. That is another negative aspect because we, the consumers tend to believe anything that is told on TV and we spend a lot of money because we want our kids to be happy and we want them to have a childhood that is worth to be remembered.
Also many advertisements are not useful and distract children from learning things that are important. They may try what is shown and get hurt.",5
55,"Television advertisement is nowadays used to get the consumer's attention and to attract them to buy a company's products.
Therefore, firms use the most abstract way to potray their product publicly. 
Children watching these advertisements are often influenced by the product's appearance in the media.
The consumption should be determined by the quality of a product rather than the appearance.
Of course, firms like ToysRus have to adapt their advertising to the group they want to target to get the best possible outcome.
But considering that today society is dependent on media more than ever, the influence ads have on both children and adults is increasingly high.
Especially kids should not be raised in such a materialized society. They cannot differ between the appearance of the product in the advertisement and the realistic relation between price and quality.
That will lead parents to buying products they would consider too expensive or not appropriate under usual circumstances.
Why should a three-year-old girl want anything else than the new robot-barbie, that is praised to be the one and only toy in advertisements?
These advertisements are created and designed for one purpose only: They're supposed to persuade children to want the product bad enough to beg their parents to buy it.
In my opinion, parents should keep their children away from TV-advertisements as long as they cannot differ between real quality and the quality the products are promised to have.
Otherwise, advertising will overcome rational consumption.",5
56,"Lastly, children at the ages from two to five experience an inmesurable amount of things throughout their day. The advertisement is just one little thing and if children don't watch TV six hours a day, they won't be influenced as much as they are influenced by their mother or father, the nature or other children. Children will like the toy but even if they never get it, if they are raised right, there is no need to be worried about them. They also learn to deal with it at an early age. They will be in contact with advertisements their whole life and if they know what to do with the information they get from the TV as early as possible, they will not be influenced as much later.",5
57,"Lastly, in many television advertising they give a wrong picture of something. If little kids see them all the time they are going to believe everything the advertiser says and preaches.They are going to want everything they see and that is stress for the parents too. There are many grown-ups that get addicted to buying things from television advertising. It is sad that this is the bigger problem than children that get influenced everyday by bad campaigns and bad deals between the newest episodes of Winnie the POOH.",5
58,"The question if television advertising for young children should not be allowed, is a question that concerns many people. There are parents who do not want their children to see it because if the children see those advertisements, they could be influenced in a way they don't even understand yet. They don't realize that in advertisements, everything is showed that it looks more beautiful as it is, and that mostly the product isn't as good as in the advertisement. 
But another question is, why shouldn't it be allowed, because young children shouldn't be watching television all the time, because it's not good for them. A child should be outside playing with other children to get more social, so the advertisment in the television shouldn't bother them at all, because they don't see it so often. But sadly, it isn't normal, that a child isn't allowed to watch television when it wants so it's a reasonable doubt if they could change their behaviour or something else because of the advertisment. I think the main problem is, that the children grow up as careless consumers when they see it, a consumer that doesn't care if he really needs the product or not and in the world there are enough of this specific kind of people. For example, a child sees a machine that can make bubbles, and is so fascinated of it, that it wants the machine no matter what. Of course the child is too young to think about the money that it costs and the water that it consumes but I think if a child is used to get things without thinking about the reasons to get it, or the use it has, it will have the behaviour as well in the future. 
Another aspect is, that the parents could be even more stressed, because their child wants all the things he sees in the advertisement. We can all imagine a young boy crying on the floor because he didn't get his water pistole he saw in the television. And if this happens a few times in a week, because the boy sees another thing he wants in an advertisment, it could be really stressfull for the parents. But there is also a good thing that advertisments for young children can do. They can show products that are healthy, for example a snack made out of fruits. If a child sees this he might change his preferences in eating, and instead of eating a chocolate bar, he'll eat a bar made out of fruits. In a time where there are a lot of people with too much weight, this is a good way to change the eating behaviour in the young ages.
In conclusion, there are a lot of negative aspects in advertisement for young children, but there are positive aspects too. For me, I don't think they are really usefull, because all they do is create a society that consumes too much, and in addition they can create problems between the parents and the children. But the most important thing is, that a child isn't at home all the time watching television, because the social contact is really important in this age.",5
59,"Television advertising is really common and most TV companies have to use it to gain the income they need to pay their ongoing costs. In their everyday programs many TV channels, depending on their target audience, sometimes or the whole day play series and movies for children often including formats for younger children aged two to five. Those children like television very much and they like to watch those channels but also those channels have to gain some money. Often they solve that issue with advertising.
The problem is that advertising for children is not the same as advertising for adults. Most Adults are mature enough to make a decision if they want to spend however much money on the product they see in advertising and they can also understand the problems they could experience after having paid too much money on a product they don't really use. In general, children aged two to five can't even propperly understand the concept of money. So they constantly ask their parents to buy them the new toy from television. And because parents love their children they often end up buing something their child uses once or twice and then doesen't even care anymore about it. Of course that is not the fault of the child but the question is if it actually is the fault of the parents who constantly buy new things for their children or if itis the fault of the TV companies who advertise to a target audience which can't make resonable descisions.",5

70,"Television is very popular in our generation and in every house you find one or more. For many families its a possibility to give their children something to do. But children cant learn to do something alone und so they arent interested in plays for their age. I think children aged two to five should not be allowed to watch TV, because it isnt good for a right education and their own development. In our society everything is used with media and you need it to live. Many parents make the mistake also with their children. They grow up with the same media problem and learn in young age how to use it. Another point is, what you see on the TV. A few years ago you had the possibility to watch series, which are also for young aged children. Nowadays you have the modern serien with guns and sexual things. It isnt save to watch TV to five years and also the ages after. Parents never really know, if its right what their children watch. We have many adults, who havent work, sit at home an do nothing. They sit the whole day at home and watch TV. Adults, as parents, are like an idol for the children and show with their lifestyle whats right and whats wrong. When young aged children to have the possibility to watch TV, you could imagine in which familiy the child grow up. The first ages are the most important years for their future life and in this time you have the best possibilities to teach them. In age from zero to five and also after they forget nothing what they have done. So in my opinion its the best way to give them something to do if you havent enough time for your childre, but the baddest way in the future of the children and not very ethical for the education.  For chiildren aged two to five it should not be allowed and the years after only a very short time and very strict.",7
71,"Televisions are something very common in our modern society. Nearly in every house is one or are more than one televisions. Everybody loves to watch TV because you do not have to think for yourself. A lot of businesses use it to make adverts. The question is: Should this be forbidden for young children? 
There are two positions to take. One is to allow this because as a mother you can put your children in front of the TV and they are happy. You can do something on your own. Maybe they even learn something. Especially series only for children can be useful. 
On the other hand there are more arguments that it should not be allowed. To much TV on each day can damage a brain very bad. The children do not have to think on their owns. The get a wrong image of the world. Even their fantasy can be blocked because they do not think and they never have to invent something during playing in the garden. Many relationships can not be developed because they do not interact with other children. At worst case not even with their parents. The can not get some faith or believe in their family. How should it work that they can become a good person. They will have many problems in school. Even during adulthood. 
Another negative point of advertisement is that they give a wrong image of the world. With advertisement you manipulate the people. They want to be like the pretty people in the clips, they want to buy the products and even they want to be like this people. Especially for children it can cause diseases. For example anorexia and others like this. They are not very selfconfident. 
My opinion about this topic is very clear. I think young children should not watch TV. The better are movie on DVD or Blue-Ray. Because there is nothing else than the movie. I think a good solution are plays or playing with other children in the neighbourhood. Probably a Babysitter can help to do something on your own for half a day. Relationships are very important. Without a family or frineds you can trust in you are nothing in your life.  ",7
72,"I would say that itÂ´s right to allow children to use the television because of the learn effect but IÂ´am not agree by let a child do what he/she want to, because just like I meantioned at the beginning in the television youÂ´ve got so many options by switching form one channel to another that you can lose the feeling of the time and start to spend to much time by watching it.
My opinion is that itÂ´s from familiy to familiy different because you canÂ´t tell your children to stop whatching television if you spend the whole time by doing it and in this point it isnÂ´t important how old these children are.I would meantion too, that the television is a medium which have a big might at which is able to form the way a human think and if a child start with young age whatching television it will be have more effect od the children ",7
73,"The question if young children should not be allowed to watch TV is not that easy to answer, there are a lot of pros and cons.
At first young people are much more easy to influence than adults so they may think that everything told on TV is real. On the other hand children are often very interested in things they donÂ´t know and they can also learn a lot while watching TV and thatÂ´s quite a good chance. 
But in this young age itÂ´s not neccessary to watch TV there are so many things they can do to learn and know whatÂ´s going on in the world. But sometimes itÂ´s just nice for the parentes to have a break and most of the childen like to watch TV and so the adults can do what they like and donÂ´t alway have to do something with their children.
The last point is that there arenÂ´t only nice and unscary movies on TV so childs can be scared or shocked by what they see.
At least i think itÂ´s okay when children watch TV but the parentes have to check what and how long they watch. There should be a limit which every family can discuss on their own, so the children know that they arenÂ´t able to sit in front of the TV the hole day. I think that it is important for the process of growing up and the individuality of everyone, to go out, meet people, make friends and so on and thatÂ´s not possible if you are just inside and never leave the house which is a risk when you have nothing to do and so just watch TV.",7
74,In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that. In the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life.,7
75,"If we say, a child can't watch TV, it plays with other untechnolized products which aren't as dangerous as technology to find out some things a children shouldn't or to see something which can dramalize a young child. But television ""canals"" mostly have some shows which are made for them and are helpfull to learn about our earth, our world and the life which is waiting for the young guys.
But a bad point of the television nowadays are the propagandas for all new playproducts. A child can always see other cool and interesting things to play and can't see how much he already has at home. So watching TV makes one's child unthankful and it wants always more. They want some things which the parents maybe can't afford and as a gift for for the last christmaspresent, they have a sad or angry child at home. They shouldn't get so influenced by the technology nowadays. It's horrible how they try to manipulate the guys before the TV. 
In this reason, it should be forbidden for the children and also for the parents.",7
76,"
All in all, I think it is the own problem of the parents if they let watching their children tv in such a young age. My opinion is that it is risky to let children watch television in a young age, because then they don't have to think by themselves and they just sit on the couch and watch straight forward. This means they could get physical and psychical problems, what could be incorrect.",7
77,"Is it okay to let young children watching televsion? This is a question on which many of the young mothers and fathers want to receive an answer. The television is a new invention and the children nowadays are the first generation who grows up with this invention. But it is very undangerous for young children? Naturally is easier for the parents if there children are quite and glad if they are watching TV. But there are other meanings. Watching too much TV can be dangerous because the children don't have enough mouvement and they learn so much if they are playing with other children in the house or in the garden. They have to have own ideas and have to respect other people. If the children are watching TV the whole day, they don't have these abilities because they can determine themselves which programme they want to watch. But there are also a lot of other abilities like motorical abilities or working with the hands, which children learn if they are playing. But there are also people who say that it is more secure to watch TV than to play in the garden. I think, yes, sure it is more secure it is more healthy to play in the garden. Probably you hit your knee, but you are better protected against infections. And if I watch the aspect about learning vital abilities it is much more helpful to play with other children than to watch TV. But in the end it should not be forbidden to watch TV but it should be very rare like once a week or something like that. I think this is the best method to educate children. Instead of giving them a TV parents should play with the children, for example a memory or read a book or paint something.",7
78,It is not good for the very young childern to watch television because it is not good for the healthy for par example for the eyes. And when the children will be older they look enough televison. That is the reason why I think televison advertising directed toward the two until five years old children should not be allowed. Because when the televison advertising should be allowed to the children then they watch televison. But in this young ages we can do a lot of other things. Probably the childern don't want go out for playing whith their friends.They are only sitting in theirs room an focused on watch TV.,7
79,"Our life includes more and more technic. It brought many advantages for our live for sure but it has a negative side too.
Technic became a big part of our live and with it television. So a point for letting children watch television at young age is, that it could be good to confront them with it already in a young age. There are also themes in the television where children can learn from. For example a film about animals or other cultures. On the other hand the mother or father could, instead of showing their child this film, look with it at a book about animals. In this case the parents could spend time with their child and be interactive with it.
But if a child only sits in front of the television it will have less time to go outside, play with children of the same age and do what children are supposed to do: Playing, running and use their creativity. That brings us to the next point. The evolution of the creativity of a child could be more difficult. And I think that is the worst part about this. If the child has never learned to occupy himself it won't be able to when it's olter too. It will continuou sitting infront of its television or computer. To build relationships will be more difficult.
So I think you deffinitely can't forbid children in young age to watch television because their parents are responsible for the education of their child. But I think one should give the parents more informations about the effect an overdosed consume of television could have in some cases. ",7
80,"The following text is an essay about the statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."".
On the positive side of advertising stands the fact that companies make a lot money from the parents which got affected by their children to buy them their toys, candy, and so on. Tv channels also make a lot money with advertising too, which is also a good thing. In the end advertising directed to children is a big and important part of the economy. 
On the negative side stands that young children between the age of two and five are easily affected by what they see in TV. So they want almost everything they see, and they get it, because theyÂ´ll bag for it until they get what they want. In the first time that does not sound really bad in any way, but if you really think about it, it is. Because the first years of a humans life are probably the most important ones. We learn the most in this years, and if we get anything we want, if our parents always buy our favourite candy at the groucery; we learn that it is normal to get anything we want, and that it is normal to always get and eat our favourite candy. Out of this facts are resulting a lot of problems, like people which think they always get what they want. And people which instinctively think it is okay to eat a lot of bad food, and then getting really obese and fat.
All in all I donÂ´t really agree or disagree with the statement. I think comercials for children should be limited, and controlled. 
And that in a way that they wonÂ´t get affected by them in the wrong way, but still learn how to handle them; because they will always face comercials in their lifes.",8
81,In this essay i am going to talk about my personal opinion on this statement. ,8
82,"The following text is about the named statement. Television is today more impportant than in the past. In the past the children go outside an play with other children. So its different than today. Most of children watch television so they are at their own. I disagree with this statement because young children aged of two to five should be learn to play with other children at their age. When they look tv the children are independent of this media so they can't live without watching tv. So the children should be play with their parents or with other children because they aren't be alone and also they meet new people. The reason is that they are in contact with others and that's better for their future. It ist so important because later they can meet new friends easier than without playing with others. The children without playimg with other children don't know the contact with others. So the relationship to other children is better when the children play with other children. 
An arguement could be that the television shows pograms which aren't good for young children. Also the pograms are for older children (aged seven). Many pograms aren't real but the children watch them and think they want do the same. So the television isn't real. Many pograms could be dangerous for young children so they dreams bad and that's not good for their little life. 
Much peeple say that television is good for their future and it's is the real life b ut it isn't it. The shows are played of actors who leatn their text and then play it for the camera and the pproducer. So it isn't the real life. 
""The children can learn of watching tv"" That isn't right because the children learn more in playing with toys. Beside they learn the rules of their parents and they know in which their are allowed to something and what it isn't allowed to do. 
So the children should'nt watch television because they are things which are better than that. Also the independence of watching television is tall so later when they are older they want watching tv all the time. Then they don't meet friends or do a hobby.
The age of two to five is the most important time of the life of a children because they learn so much about the life and deleope in a fast time. The developement of a child in this age is ",8
83,"Finally I can say that I do not agree with the given statement, bacause if you forbit something it bacomes more interesting. You have to know how to handle the modern development of technic in our world and not to allow something is not the right way. Prepare your children right for the modern world.",8
84,In the following text I will give arguments to the quote in the task and give my opinion as a conclusion.,8
85,"This essay is about the statement ""Television adversiting directed towad young children should not be allowed. 
In my opinions it is a statement, which has a lot of positiv and negativ sides. The people, who put the advertisings into the televison are doing this to sell their products. We're living in a capitalistic system, so everyone tries to get money. It does not really matter, if they try to sell it to little childs or old people. But it's not fair, that they're using manipulation in the television. Its easier to manipulate the young children. And they're abusing this. They know, that the children will try everything to get the products in the television, and they know, that a lot of partens will not say ""no"" to the whishes of their children. So they not only manipulate the children. They also manipulate the parents of them. They're right and wrong in my opinion. Right, because they just want to make money and sell their products, but also wrong, because they use young children for that. My older sister has three children, and I know how it is if they want something, they have seen in the television. They're crying to get it, and its not easy to say no like with older children. They also put children in their advertising, which are laughing and having fun. So the children, who watched the advertising think, that they'll have a lot of fun, too. But after four days, they're not playing with the toys anymore. If someone would forbid this advertsings, it would not easy anymore for them so sell their products, but its better for the children and for the partens, who cant buy new products all the time. They should forbid the advertisings in the channels, which are specially for children, like ""Disney Channel"" and ""Cartoon Network"". But then, nobody would see the products and buy it. And then, the channels would not make money anymore, because its the main source of money for them. And if they dont have money anymore, they need to shut down the channel. And I think, that the children would more cry if they can not watch cartoons , then for a toy. I disagree with the statement. The channels need the advertising and the children need the channels. And the channels are the reason, why young children are muted. So the parents need the channels, too. ",8
86,"Today I write about the statement "" Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"". One the one hand there is the fact that television advertising could change the mind of a child. But one the other hand there is the fact that they couldnt buy anything alone even if they want to.",8
87,"The following task is to state whether I agree or disagree on the quote ""Television adv ertising directed toward young children should not be allowed. First of all, it is important to know which gengre of all the things shown on the tv are shown to the kids watching tv. In some reason it is important to contrast also young people with television and its dangers. They have to get the chance to grow up with all possibilities of getting a bigger knowledge than others once. But you also have to state the fact, that children with the age of 5 or even younger cannot desicide what is good and bad or even desicide anything. So parents have to take care of them and only those can descide what their children are allowed to watch on TV or not allowed. They already got the knowledge of advantadges and dangers in contrast to their kids. They have to handle the problem if their kids watch some really awkward stuff on TV and cannot sleep at night or kids who are influenced by TV in another way. But they can also desicide what the kids are allowed to watch and it could be very helpfull for some of the kids if they learn something new, helpfull and also informative on TV to get a great knowledge. So all in all, you can say that there are lots of dangers in case of watching TV like dangers are our all problem in the whole world, but nevertheless parents have to take care of their children until they are 18 years old and live their own life. So parents should also handle the kids consumption of watching television. Maybe parents should get some help by specific people who know more about the consumption, dangers and its reasons. To sum it up and state my own opinion, I totally agree with the given quote on the top which says that Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.",8
88,"In the following text I am going to write about the statement if television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed.
First of all on the one hand young children maybe do not know what they are wishing for christmas or their birthday. If they watch TV they can get an idea of what they want.
On the other hand television advertising directed toward young childen can have such a massive impact on them. In those young years you do not know what you actually want. Every day children discover something and learn something new. So if the television tells them to like that or do this is has a such a big effect on them because they do not know yet what the main things in the world are. The television may teach them a not appropriate language and espacially when their brain is improving it can have a bad influence on them. 
Furthermore children from two to five do not know what they are even watching. You do not understand the concept of television at all at such a young age. They might get in the situation where they don not know what is reality and what is imagination.
The worst case it can get to is that the children only want to watch TV because it is so new and interesting for them. In these young ages you should not just sit in front of the TV and watch this stuff all day long. You sould go outside and play with your friends and get to know the real world.",8
89,"The statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."" is a sentence, i would discouss in the following.
Firstly i want to say that i think television is okay, but not to much, not the whole day. The childrends have to play in the nature, whoever where exactly. The forrest, the street, the garden, its not important where exactly they play but they have to play outside. I hate it when childrend are only inside and look tv ore relax the whole day. kids have to play outside and didnt watch tv the whole day. When its evening and they watch the sandman then its okay but i think young childrends arent alloud to watch much tv. Its important to find social contacts and learn things, and you could only learn this when you are with friends. In the television you can find much stupid things and worse series. Childrend coulndt notice if the series tells really things ore only stupid and unreall things. its very important to protect childrend for that, if not, then they will think that the television only tells good and really things. so i can comprimise with the statement, because i think its important to show chioldrend in this age how to play outside and have fun without television. but I although think that childrend are allow to watch tv, but only a bit and only the series which are for kids.",8
90,"In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. The influence that it takes, is just to big. Children have other options to get to know the world and see what's out there. ",9
91,So in the end I think that advertisement aimed at young children should be allowed. It won't ruin the child's live and it's the parents' duty to make sure the child is prepared to face advertisement in the future. ,9
92,"If adult people see an advertisement on television, they often don't watch to closely, they aren't interested in the majorty of the advertised products and even if they are, they are only influenced in their purchasing decision by some degree. Now a child, especially a small one views advertisement completly different, it often can not differenciate truth from lies and is way easier influenced in general. If for example an advertisement of a specific toy is shown, in which all the children posessing it are happy, the child will think its own life would definetly be better if it posessed this specific toy. This can even lead to a point where the child envies the people shown in the advertisment, even though they are only characters playing their role. The children then often try to force their parents to buy this specific toy by crying or even beating them. This is even worse if a company promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. If for example Mc'Donalds is adverstising their products beginning at a young age, many will often eat there for the rest of their lives and damage their health. So to conclude, I am against advertisement for young childen, because they are to easily infleuncable.",9
93,"In my opinion, advertising toward young children should not be allowed since the advertisers use the childish naivety and simplicity to influence kids to their profit and since it can cause an addiction to toys or new things without the kids being happy with what they have.",9
94,"In my opinion, it should not be allowed to direct advertising to young children. It is causes unnecessary problems. Kids should not be influenced by advertising. Otherwise they start to measure themself with other people and with what they have and what they don't have. ",9
95,"
In my opinion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because children are way to easy to manipulate in their age. But on the other hand I think that it is very important that parents teach their children how advertising works and how it affects the peoples minds. Furthermore companies know that children are easy to manipulate and so they are more interested in convincing children to buy their product than honestly explaining their product and it strenghts.",9
96,"Because of all these arguments listed above, I come to the conclusion that advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed. They do not have the ability to decide in terms of buying and get influenced very easily. 
 ",9
97,"I personally think, that advertising directed toward young children should still be allowed because it is a kind of force to disallow these advertisings. Further on I donÂ´t know childrens who are seriously influenced by these advertisings and who were damaged by them. ",9
98,"The advertisement is an important factor for every company around the planet. It has the power to influence the shopping behavior of people. There are advertisements just directed toward children at young age because these innocent children are easier to influence and direct than a grown adult. The question, if these commercials should be allowed, stays unanswered. 
First of all it is important that we visualize the impact on a child such a advertisement could produce. Small children are believing everything and tend to be mad if they don't get what they want. This fact makes such a advetisement a problem for the whole family of the child. It could lead to arguments between family members especially when the commercial is directed to the child but advertised a product for the parents for example a car with good seats for the children.
Secondly, is the personality of a child easily changed by subconcious messages which lead to problems with te education thought by the parents. An advertisement convincing a child subconciously to buy something or ask a parent to buy something could end with an agressive young child having problems with its all day behaiviour.
Another reason not to publish such advertisements is an economical one. Companys with products which have nothing to do with children get a huge disadvantage by such advertisements because they have to make commercials directed to adults, who are more difficult to influence.
To sum up, today there are 2468 advertisements directed just to children. It is time to act and minimize these commercials for the well being of our children. It should only be allowed to make such commercials about products which are only beneficial for young children, like lego and that kind of stuff. Let our children have a uninfluenced childhood because they are going to see enough advertisements when they are fully grown.",9
99,"In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldnÂ´t be allowed. 
Those children are in a too young age to built up their own opinion and watching advertising could influence their brain and their way of thinking a lot. Advertising with the wrong content and images could also influence their later opinion and behaviour when theyÂ´re grownn up, beacause they listened to those advertising when they were younger. Promoting more and more wrong ideals and norms advertising has so much power and could so of course have a lot impact on the youth.
In regard to this advertising for young children may not contain wrong ideals and norms, because the content for young children would be more simple and just full of things that are funny and enjoyable. 
Further more you could say that all those advertisings are always proved so that they should be save for young children to watch, but still there could always be some hidden images that the children then get to know.
The question is just: Can we trust the people who design those advertisings? Can we trust society? As itÂ´s known society puts so many wrong ideals and norms in the world, so that everybody thinks he has to follow those ideals and norms. So many grown up people are influenced by those images promoted in advertisings, that we should think about how much influence advertising than can have then on young children. They are growing up, developing an opinion and get then of course much influenced by those promoted images. 
As result advertising for young children shouldnÂ´t be allowed. They could get guided wrong and grow up with wrong images society has given them. Especially in this young age they should develop their own opinion with things they experience by their own.
