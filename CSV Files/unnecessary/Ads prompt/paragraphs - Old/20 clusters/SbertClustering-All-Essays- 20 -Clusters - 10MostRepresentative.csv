10,"In the following essay I want to point out my opinion towards television advertising addressed to young children.
Almost every household has an televison in the 21st century. Advertising is getting more popular because it is an easy way to influence the society. The impact of advertising is a controversial topic in our community.
Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed because children are not able to understand the impact of most of the products. Some of them could be harmful and children would get addicted to things which are not good for their development. On the other side even young children have the same rights than parents. They are all potential buyers in the future and ,well, watching advertisment doesnt imply buying this product. Maybe this specific advertisment helps young children to find out what they are going to wish for their birthday. First of all I have a general question. Are young children aged between 2 and 4 interested in watching television? I donÂ´t think so. On the other hand it is proofed that advertisement influences a buyerÂ´s decision. At an age of 3 children should not be confronted with advertisment because they should better go out and play with their freinds. It is also morally questionable when companies try to benefit from children. If advertisement directed towards young children would be allowed young parents who alredy got a low budget had to explain their children that they are not able to buy this product. This disappointment is not good for a young character.
If this kind of advertisemnt should be allowed we would definately need a law and an nutral institution that controlls this law. How sould it be possible for this institution to decide wheater this product is directed towards children at an age of 5? It is just logical that companies would say that their product is made for people at an age of 6 but it can also be used by younger children.
Overall I thing that television advertisement directed towards young chiildren shouldnÂ´t be allowed becuase of the mentioned facts.",1
11,"Many parents said that television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. There are many reasons which are supporting these statement. It could be helpful for young children if television advertising should not be allowed. In the following, I will explain my point of view.
However, television advertising is an entertainment for everyone, it does not matter which age you are. It is mostly better than sitting around and be bored. But there is also an other important point. Young children could use television advertising to learn something.
There are not only positive arguements, but also negative aspects.
First, television advertising is mostly unhealthy for young children. For example they can get very sick and they cannot get any friends if they are television advertising. But there is also an other arguement which do not support the statement. Children have to make expiriences in the world, and television advertising do not bring any important expiriences. 
At last, television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. The health of young children is too important and television advertising could be like a wall between the children and the society. 
",1
12,"Nowadays almost every familiy owns a TV that can be used by the every member sometimes even by young children. These affect them in different ways depending on what kind of programs are shown on TV. Sometimes even advertisement can affect them. Big companies sometimes produce commercials that are directed toward young children. In this essay i want to explain if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
One argument against this kind of advertisment is the manipulation that commercials can do. Young kids can not decide maturely so it can be dangerous to them. Another argument against television advertising towards young children is that after seeing such a commercial kids want such products though parents rarely would buy or can't afford it what makes kids very sad.
An argument in favour could be that it teaches kids a lesson because they can't and won't have eveything in life. Another pro argument is that kids could be influenced by commecials with good purpose as for example anti-racism campaigns.
In my opinion television advertising toward young children should be allowed but only if they have a good purpose.",1
13,"A controversal topic nowadays is television advertising. Some people think, that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed. In the following I will comment on that topic. 
Firstly you can say, that these advertisments, towards young chilren, offer the producer a bigger frame of costumers. Often advertisments are directed towards adults or teens, so that they buy certain products, but also if an advertisment does not catch an adults or teens attention, a young child can influence their parents to be interested in that special product, so that they look at it again.
Furthermore especially young children are easy to influence and so they believe everything said in the advertisment. They do not have as many life experience as their older siblings or parents and so they believe especially people, who seem trustful, alot and when it is a good advertisment they can get influenced by it very much.
Young children at the age from two to five should not be allowed to watch television or television advertesments. In the age of two to five they should play outside with friends. They should not sit inside and watch television alot, perhaps in the evenings, the children program, but there are no advertisments in these special shows for young children.Television advertisement can influence their personalities in wanting everything. Young children, who watch much television or television advertisments can get badly influenced by these, because they often tell you, that you should definitly buy the product and so their character can get influenced in wanting everything.
To sum it all up, I would say, that these television advertisments towards young children should not be allowed, in the reason, that it could influience their life in a bad way, and noone wants that for their child.",1
14,"In the following text I will discuss the question, if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not. This is a topic many people disuss and it is not easy to say if it should be allowed or not. There are many points that have to be discussed, to make a decision about it.
One argument to allow the television advertising directed towards young children is that these children feel part of the society, otherwise it could be that children do not feel involved. On the other side it could be kind of manipulation to direct television advertising towards children. There are too young to deside on their own if an advertising or the product in it, is good or not. That could be also an argument for television advertising directed towards children. Maybe they could learn to deside on their own with this advertising. For sure it would be better when parents could help their children in another way to learn how to make decisions. 
Another argument for showing advertising directly to kids is that it could be boring for children when they see advertising for adults only. 
There are more arguments to show advertising to children directly, but the only real good argument is that it could be to boring for children to only watch advertisments for adults. But anyway I will agree to this statement, because IÂ´m sure there are way more better activities for children from two to five than to watch television and the advertisments.",1
15,"Television advertising directed toward young children is a controversial topic. Some people think it is okay at the age of two to five, other people think it should not be allowed. In the following text I will give reasons for and against it and tell you my opinion about this.
One reason for that advertising could be that children get in contact with the medium at a young age. Like in today's world they grow up with such ""influence"". A reason against it, which is mentioned often, is that children, especially young children, will become numb because of the huge influence that the TV and, not only but surely, advertising have. Another reason against it is that the parents of the child should have the control over what they buy for it. Of course they should look at the wishes of their child. On the other hand there are things being advertised which are not suitable for a child and these wishes should not be accepted. A reason for the early advertising could be that the children can specialise themselves on what they like and what they do not like.
All in all I think there should be this form of advertising. It does not harm the children. In addition the parents need to have the control over what their children are watching. Not when they are older but at this young age.    ",1
16,"In the following text I want to discuss if television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not.
In general I think it is a very normal thing that firm and concernes make adverts to inform people about new products. They need it to have a successfull firma. But the negative aspect of these adverts is the fact that they often do not tell the truth about a firma or his products, they just should convince the people to buy this product or to support this concernes.
I think older people like adults or children from 15 years and up can reflect the liing and the truth on these adverts so that they do not buy things without thinking on their own if the price is fitting and the products are as good and usefull as they are presented in the adverts.
Against this young children from two to five years can not think about these positive and negative aspects so that it is a very easy thing to have some influence on them. Especially the television is a medium wich young children like very much, they spent a lot of time in front of it and think that everything on this screen must be the truth an a very good thing.
Furthermore the first few years in the life of a human are the ones in which they learn the most things and in which it decides who they are going to be and what they like and what not. That is the reason why firms ",1
17,Nowadays our TV is plenty of advertising and not only to adults or teenager also to little childrens in the age of two to five. In the following essay I want to raise the question if TV advertising dirceted toward young children should be allowed.,1
18,"Advertisement has become a debated tobic in our modern society, most specificly in the world of television. Advertisetments inspire people from all ages to buy a product, which they sometimes dont even need. Especially children are easy to be manipulated by advertisements. The question is, should Television advertising directed toward young children be prohibited? In this essay i will list the pro and cons and come to a rational conclusion.",1
19,In these days everyone wants to make as much profit as possible and therefore advertising and especially television advertising gets more and more important. But often they can influence people and especially children to buy things they do not really need. In this essay I will discuss the question whether television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.,1
20,"One reasen for arguing this these is that the raise of the children at this age, should fully be under contol of their parents. It is very dangerous showing children stuff on television, because a lot of children do what they see, so if there is someting showed on televison, it must be sure that children don't come on stupid ideas. ",2
21,"On one hand, we have the manipulation effect from advertisement on children, but on the other hand, we all know, that children once become adults. As an adult you have the same problems but they are even much biger and diverse. So why should the children be protected of this problems? If they are faced up to reality at there prime of life they learn much earlier how to deal with there problems.",2
22,I agree with this statment because young children can be easly influence. But ,2
23,Children aged two to five have to learn very much about live. For example about their needs and how they had to react in diffrent situations. One of this situation is the television advertising. They had to diside whether they resist this advertising or not. If not they had to ask their parents whether they could buy them this things. And than it is by the parents if their child gets this thing. For example the child watches TV his favourit series dragons or somthing and after it comes an advertising about a figur from this film whitch one can by in the supermarket. After that the child goes to his mom and ask her to buy this figur. So their is a secound opinion which knows more about the world and how it works. But when the child starts annouing his mother she maby desids against her on opinion and than the advertising has the chance to manipulat the child with more and more new figurs of this series and the child wants them all but the mother do not want to buy them. When this happens the child maby goes to the supermarket and buys tehem by itselfs. But the child can not do that because its to young. An other example is if the mother says yes but buys it with the money of the child. Than the child learns when it has enough money to buy the next figur that it can not have everything. This child will grow up and knows how to spend its money without a helping hand. It would not buy evrthing what the advertising says instad of bthe other child who maby would. In my opinion television advertising directed toward children aged two to five should be allowed to teach the children how to act in this situations. But the parents have to know how they had to react. When a brefed mother or father is given it would work and television advetising should be allowed.,2
24,"Young children aren't interested in advertising. They don't care about things like that, they are happy with what they have and that they could play with it. Advertising would only change their interests into bad and made them unhappier. Mabey they are confused because they couldn't understand the advertise.
When the advertise makes the children confused, it isn't good for the company either. They try to sell their products, but when children couldn't understand their advertise, they will not play with things like this.
But when the advertisment is easy to understand and the children like it, it is kind of good for the company. Young children only see thinks and thing ""I want to have this!"" Now, they try to make their parents buy this. For some products, they may win and the company becomes more money. But that's the only reason I see, to show young children adverstising on television.
Advertising could influence young children very easy. That is good for the companys and the industrie, nor for the children and the parents. And there is also the moral question, if you can use children for industrial movements.
I thing, that isn't okay. For the children it's better to have their childtime free from television, mobile phones, social media and marketing strategies. But in this time, it's kind of unrealistic to live without television and so one. So it should ce clear, that the children are safe to. I don't want my child to be influenced by things for adults, like avertising and stuff. Early and long enough, they must life with that.
Can't they live their first years free from klischees, predjudees and stereotyes?
Can't they get older without influence by marketing strategiers?",2
25,On the other hand you could say that it is morally not correct to try to influence audience at such a young age. Consequently the government should lawfully forbid it because it should not be allowed to act legally in an unmoral way and especially if it concernces helpless kids.,2
26,If you want to do something in the opposite direction you would have to start to educate the parents because the children dont have an own opinion in that young age. ,2
27,"On the other hand side one has to consider that young children are very easy to manipulate. With a less experienced and educated mind they are a easy target for advertising and can more easily fall for subjective and incorrect advertisement.
Also the children who saw those ads can afterwards be so obsessed with the presented article that the could try and force their parents into buying that product for them.
Finally by allowing television advertising directed toward young children on secretly supports young children in watching TV. It is scientifically proven that TV is not good for young children and can really hinder their development. Is a thing so bad for the childs development really to be supported?",2
28,"Firstly, I think that it is not ethic to try to manipulate little children. They cannot even think for themselves and that is why it should not be allowed.",2
29,But in general I stay by my opinion I disagree with the statement. The best argument is the parents should control it and you never can say this advise is for children and this not. Where is the frontier between them? I rather don't know where and the managers of the tv channels have got the same problem. ,2
30,"In the following text i will comment the statement that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.                                     
First I give you some points to disagree with this statement. Most of the children aged two to five will watch tv everyday so it does not matter if they are watching advertising made for them or not. Furthermore it is even better that they have advertising for them instead of watching some durex advertising or something because that might hurt their brains more than the new Winnie Pooh Bear or something else.
Otherwise it is not really positive to show the children that much television because they should do something outside and not watching tv the whole time. So the children allready watch that much tv that they should not also have some advertising which might addict them to buy something or saying their parents that they need to have this otherwise they will be bored for sure or something like this. So it should not be the aim of the parents to let their children watch tv the whole day and if there is advertising not directed to them they will have not that much interesst to watch tv so they do not watch that much tv automaticly.
To put it in a nutshell i think that there are pretty much opinions for the advertising directed to young children and today it might be usual that young children watch tv not like twenty years ago when everyone want to go out and play football or something and furthermore it is propably not the best idea to connect the advertising to young children because they should not get addicted from tv that fast. They should still have the chance to have a nice growing up without that much tv and playing outside or something, of course the time has changed and without electronic hardware there is no life but in the young ages you do not need this to have fun.",3
31,"Television advertising directed toward young children is a common topic. There are many arguments for and against.
So I will explain one or two.
The people that are against advertising directet toward young children, argue, that the influence of young kids is enormeous, because they can't triage the informations. So they want to have all of the objects they had seen on TV. But there are as always people that are in favour to tv advertising toward young children, because the children learn how to handle the source of advertising, and learn, that they d'ont need all, what they saw in TV. 
My opignion is like the first argument. I think that television advertising toward young children should not be allowed. The kids shoulden't sit for a long time in front of the TV, they should go out in the nature and play games. If the kids are out, they can not watch TV advertising.So the problem is solved.
So I agree with the statement.",3
32,"So in conclusion, I agree with the statement that television advertising directed toward children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. They are two young to see the difference between television and reality and its easy to manipulate them to get money. Apart from the point that too much television is not good for children, in my opinion the advertising only includes advantages for the ones making it.
 ",3
33,"I think, I agree with the statement, that television advertising should not be allowed by young children. At first I would say that children at the age of two to five are too young to know many things about the world. They live in a world full of many other children and they have no idea what is really going on. So I think they should do other things than beeing in a television advertising. They should go outside, play with friends and have fun. 
Everytime I look TV and I see young children are in a television advertising, I ask myself: If that is you, what would you do? I would say, I would never be in a television advertising when I were two to five years old. I think young children should be free and they have to enjoy life to the fullest. Because when you get older, you will go to school every following day, at the afternoon you have to learn and you have to do your homework. When you get older you have to work harder, you can't play with other children the whole day. And there are many other things that aren't really great when you get older. 
So when you're older and you would like to do other things than going to school or going to work, you can decide if you want to be in a television advertising. At the age of two to five you can't decide if you want to or not. I think at this age the parents decide what things the children are doing. Because of these examples I have written, I say that television advertising directed toward young childred at the age of two to five should not be allowed.",3
34,"Television advertising dircted toward young children should not be allowed. I really agree with this statement and I will show you the reasons in the following text.
A boy watch television and after every thirty minutes there comes different advertising for ten minutes. The young boy ,who is just two to five years old see the advertising and that ist not very good. At first he will be influenced with five years or lower. That could be very bad for his following future. For example: He watchs very often TV and because of that he realize all the new products, which he always want to buy. 
The advertising for young children is very attractive for them, because there they show the young children new ""Barbies"" or anything else. The hypothalamus, the most important thing of the head, of the children is not completly produced. So they can not devide between the advertising that is good for them and the advertising that should manipulate them. 
Arguments against the advertising toward children are in the following text. A young child, aged two to five, should not watch television. And if they don't watch television they won't be influenced. So in my opinion the parents should have a look on their children and control they media life of their child.
The reason of advertising is that it should make the people buy these things in the supermarket for much money. ",3
35,"I disagree with this statement, because in my opinion, television advertising directed toward children under 5 years, should not be allowed.I think there are many reasons. But why?
Firstly I think, it's not such a good idea to let young children watching TV in general, because in this age, there is so much to do. They should go out and learn how to interact with the natur and to discover it. Also young children should not be under influence of the meaning of others, for example of the meaning of a boss of NestlÃ©. The young children are to young to decide, whats is true and possibe and what is impossible in an advertising. For example an advertising of RedBull says, that you can fly, if you've drunk a RedBull. If a young children don't know, that this is impossble, the child might try it out and fails. Also most of the advertsing things are not healthy, but a young children don't know this, and ask the mum often, to buy this product.But I also think, that the solution is not, that children now just should watch advertising for parents.I think children shouldn't watch TV in general, and it should be forbitten to ad an advertsing between, before and after a child-TV-Programm. ",3
36,"I agree that some advertisement at the television can be dangerous for young children. Children in this age can easily be manipulated and are open for any influences. In addition to that the children of the current generations are spending more and more time watching television, so the danger will increase in the future. Children at this age canÂ´t really see wether itÂ´s a true statement in the advertisment or if itÂ´s a lie. Even in some advertisements where their parents would clearly understand that itÂ´s not true. The consequences of this bad influence could be that young children increasingly think that they need to buy things to be accepted and to be popular, pretty or even intelligent. On the other hand the children will be sooner or later confronted by advertisements, even if they didnÂ´t watched television advertisements when they were 3 or five. So it would not change much to not allow it when they are so young.
Another argument against the statement is that advertisements with bad influece arenÂ´t only at the television. Young children can be manipulated and influenced by advertisments everywhere, wether itÂ´s a mall or a supermarket. So it would not help to keep the children away from the advertisements at the television. I think only the parents should be responsible aobut their childrens well being. They should make sure that the children know that they dont need things to be a better person and that the advertisements (not only at the telvision) arenÂ´t always real. If the parents are aware of the possible danger of the advertisments. I donÂ´t think itÂ´s necessary to not allow television advertising directed toward young children.",3
37,"I agree with the statement, that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because on the one hand the brains of young children are not as developed as the brains of teenagers or older people. Young children are very sensible for new things and when they watch these advertisments they think they must own these things, presented in advertisments, so they want their parents to buy all that much unnesessary stuff like plastic toys.
Another reason, why television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children is, that they are hanging arround in front of the tv the whole day. The children could learn bad things from the advertisments instead of playing outside with their friends. Friends are better for thier social development than the tv.
But on the other hand it is a good method for the companies, which produses the toys, to earn money, because many parents buy new things, when young children told them to buy it. With the new money the companies could invent new toys for the children, perhaps better toys. It is also good for the economy when companies earn more money, so they could expand and unemployed people could find work.
My opinion is, that television advertising shouldn't be allowed becouse it is not good for th",3
38,"Television advertising directed toward young children between two and five should not be allowed.
I agree with the statement above for the following reasons.
At first, advertising on television will cause that children want the things they see. A good example for this is, when they make promotion of a game, the young will show it to their parents. This leads to finally buying the game for their daugther or for their son.
Furthermore, children will learn at such young age that the world is full of promotion. This is how they get to know todays world. Maybe this will help them to think intelligent in school and in their lives.
In the other hand, the two to five aged need to watch programmes specific for their age, for example ''Dora Explora''. This is a television show where the young are able to learn new things. It is way better for them.
Moreover, it could be possible that television advertising will cause a lot of more questions than answers because they are very young aged.
In my opinion, the two to five aged don't need to watch a lot of TV at all. Of course they can learn something but there are better ways for that. Television advertising can also give parents problems when they don't have enough money for everything their child sees in the promotion. That is why I agree with the statement above.
In conclusion, it is a fact that advertising on TV is not very relaxing for young aged and for the adult because it takes a lot of their free time.",3
39,"The topic of advertising in the tv to young children is difficult. Children shouldnÂ´t watch tv often in that age, thatÂ´s clearly. For the concerns itÂ´s very lucrative to do advertising to young people because they watch it, they want it and they go to their parents to talk with them if the children are allowed to get it. But itÂ´s the wrong way to use young children to make profit. Maybe it isnÂ´t wrong to start in a young age with that things. So the children may know what will happend in an older age. Everyone is controlled by the media, at all in the digitalized (like tv or radio) and in the undigitalized way (like newspaper).
Finally I agree with the statement.
I think that shouldnÂ´t be allowed because the children have to play outside with friends or get wet from the rain without any problem. They should not controle by the media so early. ",3
40,"In my opinion television advertising directed to young children should not be allowed because these
",4
41,"To sum up, in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children shoud not be allowed as it is manipulating, influences their development and harms the environment.",4
42,"I think television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed, because they're unnessesary and cause more problems than you would expect. ",4
43,All in all you can say that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because it influences them too much and makes them believe in things that do not exist. ,4
44,So in my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed since all the arguments which say that it should not be permmitted can be easily ,4
45,For these reasons i'm agree that television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowe,4
46,In the end I think that television advertising which is directed to young children should not be allowed because it abuses the lack of knowledge that children have. ,4
47,Television advertising direct toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed,4
48,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed,4
49,Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed,4
50,Televison is something so important for the people in community that we can`t live without televison. From time to time the children started watching television earlier in their lifes.  But television for young children isn`t in every situation something good. With the television children are able to learn a lot. There are a lot of TV programms in which children can learn a lot about animals and the nature etc. With the televiosion they are using their time with learning new things and don`t vasting their time. In some cases is it also useful to help learning a language. But there are also a lot of negative points. They can lose their sozial connection to other persons if they are only watching TV. They don`t go out and play with some other children for example. An other point ist that they can developp an addiction to the television. If they are addicted they will not be interested in other things what could be a problem for their future. An other problem of television is that TV isn`t really for 100% exactly. We don`t realize that but our brain. For example the sound and the movement of the lips from the persons in TV when the have a dialog or something like that isn`t exactly to the same time. The timing is not correct. Our brain realize that. And in this young years of the children the brain can save a lot of informations. And when for example this timing isn`t for 100% correct they don`t learn for example a language. It is more useful to learn a language when the children listen to a person who read a book in this language. In our age we don`t realize so small mistakes of TV. I would clearly say that it is mor useful for young children if they watch not a lot TV or start to watch when they are seven or older. They learn more when the play with other children or listen to persons who read something for them. In my opinion is it completly unnecessary when children start watching TV with two years. I support that television advertesing directed toward young children shouldn`t be allowed.      ,5
51,"This statement is a controversial theme. 
The children are even more younger when there starting to watch television and some parents don't care because the children are busy and couldn't go on there nerves. On the other side it isn't good for them because they can become bad eyes or don't go outside anymore. 
The young children will be learn the wrong things and if they are looking to much television they can be stressed and want to look even more TV.
In our society it isn't possible to say that the young children shouldn't watch Tv because it's a very big problem when everyone is watching it the whole time and they musn't. In comparison to that point it's so important for there rising to have freetime and play outside with friends. 
If they are watchuing television the whole time they are sitting in a room without freshly air and forget the time. Most of the time the parents don't think about this problem because of our technologe societiy.
Finally it's important for children to go outside and communicate. Television can make them nervous and often they watch the wrong things so they learn bad vocabulary for the future and mostly haven't the same experiences as others. ",5
52,"Many children are watching TV daily. The time goes faster and the parents don't have to care about them. Television has a big influence to the children. They can be scared of a movie, impressed by a hero or even learn something about the life. ",5
53,"This subject had been often discussed, if young children should watch television or not. I think also it depends in wich country we are, in some countries there isn't a problem with that, in other that's a big problem. First of all I think, the young children have better things to do than watching television. The time you're spending on the television, is a time wasted. The young children should go out and paly with other children. When I was young I always went outdoors and played with the children in the street. The chidlren, who are so young, they shouln't spend so much time on the television. An other suspect is physical, I mean the young children, they watch TV so close on the screen and this isn't good for the eyes. They are really fragile and it's not worth to damage them, because the chidlren want to watch television. For example, a friend of mine, in the young age, he had really problems with his eyes, and his parents didn't know what it was , so they went to the doctor and and after five minutes  the doctor said, if my friend would watch a lot of television,because the lightning of the screen isn't healthy for our eyes. Since than my friend really stopped watching series or something else. Instead he went more often out with his friend or he read a lot, That's why he became today a very good writer, maybe one day he's gonna be a very good journalist. Like I mentionned, the young children coud read books and do something in their lifes, which they can profit of. 
On the other side, the children can learn from television. It also depends what you're watching or which serires. For example there is one serie, it called Dorie and there can chidlren learn speaking english, or some sentences. So it doesn't have to be always bad for the children, and so I think,it shouln't be forbidden. I think just the parents have to look after their children, that they have both of them. ",5
54,"But on the other hand the children could get dependent  on watching television. in the small age of  two to five it would be horrorbly to be dependent to watch TV every time.  They wouldnt go out, play in the nature and meet friends on the streets. For myself it was the best childhood to play in the garden, in the sand or on the street with some friends out of my village. i cant imagine to sit on the tv everytime.
on other point is,that the picture that are shown on the tv are too fast for the eyes of the young children. the brain cant work with the information it gets from all the pictures. it could be the reason for many health problems in the older age.
the parents that let their children watch tv every day, every time will probably see it in the grades of the children when they are students. They wont be as concentrated as other students and wont be as focused. and they wont be as creative as the other students, that told their friends stories about their dreams.",5
55,"First I want to look at the position of people who are against the television. Their probably biggest argument is, that the TV is not good for our eyes. But another very big argument, I want to write about is the neglection of their social Â¨lives. Children who watch too much TV do not care anymore about their real lifewith their true friends and prefer to watch Tv than to go out.These people may have a big disadvantage in their lives. It is not good if a child is watching TV because it is bad for social lifes in the future and maybe they will get bullied later in their lifes because others who did not watch TV have friends and they have not. That is a true sign that the TV and other mediasare not good for children and they should better go out and play football or other games like we did when we were children.",5
56,"The television is some you find in every house, every appartment or even in a camping trailer. Noone want to miss something exciting happen in another part of the world. But televion is not only for informing everybody about the newest topics. It also should entertain and teach you in several things. 
But they arenÂ´t only adults watching the TV(television) there are also childs  wathing even the ones who are two years old. And many critice want to change that they think that the children will get silly when they are whatching TV at that young age and that they should play in the garden to grow up like they did.
But do really get more silly when you are wthing TV? no because their is no proof for such an Argument and so the argument of the critics have no right to claim this argument. Even more some of the child TV-shows try to bring the kids some Knowledge and they arenÂ´t just entertaint they learn something. 
But they are still arguing that they arenÂ´t playing in the garden any longerand that parents donÂ´t do their job proberly and that they donÂ´t want any hard problems during raising up the childs. so they just let them sit in frotn of the TV and do theire job with homeoffice. That is not ok Children like wahtching the TV and this is okay. But the parents need to showup some borders and let their kids know that their is time for TV and time for somthing else like sport or reading a book. These two things are also important for kids and their need to be a mixture between all things a child need to grow up. Just like it ever has been the only thing that changed is that with the TV there is a new option to get childs something to know. But it shouldnÂ´t be over used because that could leed to adiction and children can not use their time for sport or somthing like that.",5
57,"As conclusion my opinion is clear. I think there are so many other possibilitys to waste the time in the childhood and not watch television. It is very important to learn how to be social or how dicover something or to fight with other kids. It is all a part of the evolution of children an if this evolution is damaged because of the television, the future can also be damaged because they do not know practical things in live, they only know who is the aunt of the best friend of the mainfigure in their favourite television show what is not very important to know in live.",5
58,"Nowerdays often the question if young people should watch TV comes up to our minds.Today many young children watch TV because their parents have no time to play with their children.
In my opinion it is not good for so young people to watch TV the hole day. Children in this age should play outside with other children in their ages. It is important for them to have social contact to know how to act infront other people. Young children learn the most with other peolpe in the same age.
When they watch TV it is also possible to learn new things, so you have to know the difference between some channels. Some channels are very helpful to learn the language or the numbers but other channels do not have a learneffect. They are only there for entertainement what is not the best for little children.
Young children should play with friends in the same age or with there parents and other familymembers. At a special age it is okay to watch TV but not the hole day. I think a two years old child do not have to watch TV to be entertaint it should play to have fun. I think with five years it were okay when the child watch half an hour the day TV. 
So in my opinion you have to know the differnence between the age of a child and the TV channel it is also important to look at the time, how long a child watch TV. So in the end every parent have a other opinion to this theme and have to know it for himself.",5
59,"Children often donÂ´t know what to do. So parnets put them infront of a TV. But is this really the right thing to do when your kid is between aged two to five? If the parents have many things they have to do and the child is only annoying then it is a good thing to show the kid a serie. It is not okay to think that your child is annoying but that is a different subject. Through TV- shows kids can learn many things, e.g. colours but also cultural normes like sharing to other peoeple or that it isnÂ´t okay to hurt somebody. There are also some shows where kids can learn other languages. But on the other side scientists found out that kids could get ill from watching TV. Young children can only see many many pictures which changes very quickly. They couldnÂ´t realize what happens and canÂ´t understand what a TV is. Also there is a lack of communication when children watch too early too much TV. They canÂ´t say what they feel or want because they have less words to use. And in general it is better to care about the children. When parents decide to have a baby then they have to spent time with her/him, even if it is a difficult situation. Kids learn a lot when for example the parents read them something out. They know how to listen and how to learn by heart. I think it is okay for young children to watch TV once a week but only for half an hour and only if the kid wants it. The shows must be checked by parents if it is a reaaly good one and donÂ´t get the children be stupid (like the Teletabbies). But there are many other activities to do. The kid has to learn how to do something alone when he has nothing to do, TV arenÂ´t allowed to be the answer. He has to get a social life even it is a young person. Otherwise they donÂ´t learn how to share in real life or all those cultural normes. So I would more agree with the statement that Television advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed. ",5
60,"I don't think that banning advertisments is the right way to protect young childrens. Sure, if there isn't any temptation, it is easier to resist, but they also have to learn to deal with it. To see something and not have the urgent need to get it, and also being able to know that is real and what is not. But the question is, are childrens by the age of two to five already able to do that? Probably not, so: If parents let their childs watch telly at such a early age, they have to be ready to explain them a lot and resist the crying of a two years old in the supermarket, who absolutely wants that toy she saw in the commercial. To be done on own risk. ",6
61,"Child protection is a  very important matter, and in every case politicians and foremost parents try to protect or isolate them from everything that possibly could hurt or damage their tiny heads. Rightfully so, advertising for a consumer group this young is irritating. Children are in their earliest stages of development and very fragile. On the other hand, do children aged 2 to 5 watch even Tv? And even if they get influenced by advertisements, does it matter? Every good parent wil supervise the kids' hunger for material consume; advertisements do not work when the target audience has no money, can hardly speak correlating sentences and cries a lot. Being no expert in either childrens TV or advertising for said age group, I am not too sure if there is a substantual amount of advertising for children that could be banned.  In this case, banning an non-existentual thing does no make sense. Another important question is, if children aged 2 to 5 really are more influenceable by advertisements than any other age group. At this stage, why not ban advertisements for everyone? Adult humans are much more in danger to act the way the advertisement wants, because of the factors money, frustration, boasting and greed. ",6
62,In my opinion banning television advertisings that are specificly going to young children is just something to hide the reality from them. But it would definetly help if parents try to tell the kids what the advertising is trying to do and how it tries to manipulate them. So the kids have a basic knowledge on how adverstisements are made and how they work so they do not just believe everything they see in their television device.,6
63,"Ptotcting children from all advertisements is not possible in such a globalised and media- dependant world as ours. If parents don't want their children in the age from two to five to be exposed to telecasted advertisment, a ban is not the solution. In my oinion, they should not allow them to watch tv. This does not mean that their children would not have any contact to any advertisement, but they would be protected from the most popular and therefore most influencial type of advertisement.",6
64,"To start, I think that children aged two shouldn't even be allowed to watch television so much that they could be influenced by the advertisment. But in general I think it's the parents task to be aware of the danger which comes from ads in television. So they should decide whether their child is allowed to watch television. I think it is impossible to ban ads from TV because the chanels earn so much money from them. Of course there is the danger that young children can be easely influenced from TV advertisement and could have a wrong opinion of something. But in the world there are many other things that could have a bad influence on a child. So now, my opinion ist that the parents have to deal the same with TV advertisements than with other threats for their child. They must prevent their child from being influenced. They can tell their child what's wrong or just invented in the advertisements or they can watch less TV (rather unpopular).",6
65,"Of course there's also an economical aspect because that's what advertisment is all about, economics. There are thousands of enterprises which are simply based on selling toys to kids. And of course their system wouldn't work anymore without advertising their products in national television. If now television advertising for kids wouldn't be allowed anymore all these enterprises would crash. So completely disallow television advertising for kids isn't really realistic. But I guess children can't handle all the influences television has on them on their own. Parents must supervise their children's behaviour when it comes to television. Also advertisment toward young children should be controlled more. It doesn't take much to convince children, so we have to protect them from all influences. Children shouldn't be abused to make money. Everything sold to children should help them to learn and discover stuff and there are lots of products on the market that don't do that. ",6
66,I think it is not necessary to put advertises on television channels for children. My opinion is that young childreen watch too much television on general. It would be difficult to ban all advertises on every channel because many children do not only watch channels and series they are meant to watch. I think most parents aren't concsious about the consequences what too much watching television does to young children. What series and what channels the younger watch is a bigger problem. Banning advertising won't solve this probelm. ,6
67,"Times have changed in terms of raising a child. New technology has come and nowadays can't be ignored. Kids from young age on get used to a TV, a mobile phone and the computer. With the use of the new technology comes advertisement. But advertisment isn't only just bad and not good for the kids. It gives them, for example ideas for christmas or their birthday. It gives them something to dream of or talk about with their friends. And this can also happen to children aged two to five. Channels and companys need advertisement to promote of finance themselves. There is no difference between going outside and seeing a huge board with advertisement or wathing TV and have a small spot between your show. 
But there's of course not only ""good"" advertisement. Many try to controll kids and promote things which are not only heavily overprized but maybe even bad for the children because it contains small things that they can swallow and in the worst case even die. 
In my perspective advertisement should be sorted. The age from two to five is one of the most important phases of a growing children and it's a learning phase in which they more or less believe everything you will say. As a child I watched TV aswell and the ad-breaks weren't the most fun so I did something else. This shows you that ad's have of course a impact on the minds of little kids, but they also have a own opinion and won't be controlled by the advertisment. It's all about how and what you promote and what is allowed to promote. That's is why I think that advertising isn't always bad, but should definitly be sorted. Also it's pretty rough to only ban ad's for young children, because not only young children watch those channels and others who were wathing could be offended because they acutally wanted to see the ad's. ",6
68,"Television avertising isn't only a huge business it's also an often discussed topic with really really different opinions. Advertising for cigarettes or alcohol aren't the only critical ones.Those spots which are directed towards children are also well discussed. But are children a good victim eventhough they can't buy these things for themselves. 
Clear is that children are fascinated from the television and that they love to spend a lot of time in front of it. Parents know that, and advertising companies are aware of this too. Because of this they adress their advertising exactly to the children. They use a lot of colors, a nice design and lots of good sounding words. And exactly this is a problem with these advertising spots, childern only see the positive side of the products and they can't think about consequences or if they really need this product. They just see the advertising and they want it. They also aren't able to differantiate advertising from the reality. Because of this they may think someting is healty or useful even it's not. 
On the other hand it's clear that they can't just go and buy the product they saw in the advertising. It's necessary to ask the parents or someone else to buy it because children aged two to five normally don't own any money. For the parents it may be annoying if their children come everyday and ask for something they saw in the advertising. But that's not a reason to ban these television spots. As a parent you have to say 'no' to your child a lot. And only because you're annoyed of something you can't just ban it. Your child will always see thing which it doesn't have and wants it now. Independant of television advertising there will be arguments about stuff they want but don't get it. Additionnally advertising is a huge business and it'll always be a big business, with or without children advertising. 
All in all I think it's silly to ban television advertising directed to children. It's normal to argue with your child about things they don't have and if you can't say no to something your child wants because it has seen an advertising you really need to think about your parenting. Advertising is business and that's the way it is. Additionally if your child learns early to be critical against advertising and that sometimes you have to accept a 'no' it'll go stronger through its life. And at the end you can't always keep everthing away from your child and you can't always ban things you don't like or things which annoy you. ",6
69,"There are several points that support the idea of banning television advertising for young children in order to keep them protected from being manipulated.
Companies know, that small children, whose parents are stressed and more or less careless in modern times, have a big influence on their parents and their shopping. So when mama or papa leave the house, they often let their child sitting in front of the tv, letting it watch his favourite show.
By using this kind of knowledge, companies try every kind of advertising beneath the series/programmes or in the shows themselves in order to convince the children, that this product is neccessary for their ""further life"". 
The children then tell their parents their new favourite product and wonÂ´t stop begging for it until itÂ´s in their hands. Kids are used as an indirect way to force their parents to buy companies products and are therefore intentionally manipulated. Compared to modern regulation and law standards, these methods could be called a child abuse, as kids mental unstabilities are abused willingly in hope to gain the most profitable advertising methos. 
With this fact in mind, everyone would be interested in stopping this kind of manipulative and abusing advertising, especially if it could reach their own child.",6
70,"The advertisement is an important factor for every company around the planet. It has the power to influence the shopping behavior of people. There are advertisements just directed toward children at young age because these innocent children are easier to influence and direct than a grown adult. The question, if these commercials should be allowed, stays unanswered. 
First of all it is important that we visualize the impact on a child such a advertisement could produce. Small children are believing everything and tend to be mad if they don't get what they want. This fact makes such a advetisement a problem for the whole family of the child. It could lead to arguments between family members especially when the commercial is directed to the child but advertised a product for the parents for example a car with good seats for the children.
Secondly, is the personality of a child easily changed by subconcious messages which lead to problems with te education thought by the parents. An advertisement convincing a child subconciously to buy something or ask a parent to buy something could end with an agressive young child having problems with its all day behaiviour.
Another reason not to publish such advertisements is an economical one. Companys with products which have nothing to do with children get a huge disadvantage by such advertisements because they have to make commercials directed to adults, who are more difficult to influence.
To sum up, today there are 2468 advertisements directed just to children. It is time to act and minimize these commercials for the well being of our children. It should only be allowed to make such commercials about products which are only beneficial for young children, like lego and that kind of stuff. Let our children have a uninfluenced childhood because they are going to see enough advertisements when they are fully grown.",7
71,"If adult people see an advertisement on television, they often don't watch to closely, they aren't interested in the majorty of the advertised products and even if they are, they are only influenced in their purchasing decision by some degree. Now a child, especially a small one views advertisement completly different, it often can not differenciate truth from lies and is way easier influenced in general. If for example an advertisement of a specific toy is shown, in which all the children posessing it are happy, the child will think its own life would definetly be better if it posessed this specific toy. This can even lead to a point where the child envies the people shown in the advertisment, even though they are only characters playing their role. The children then often try to force their parents to buy this specific toy by crying or even beating them. This is even worse if a company promotes an unhealthy lifestyle. If for example Mc'Donalds is adverstising their products beginning at a young age, many will often eat there for the rest of their lives and damage their health. So to conclude, I am against advertisement for young childen, because they are to easily infleuncable.",7
72,"Television advertising for young children should not be allowed because the young children don't really have the ability to understand and to think about the things that the ad communicates. The children just think:""oh I want to play with that"" and are saying this to their parents. But often the ad is not something good and manipulates the child. It manipulates the will to play and the will for adventure. But at the end it can be a bad product and not worth the money. The parents then have to buy it or make the child sad and to ignore the wish. Just because the children cannot yet analyse and think through the advertisement. I think that an advertisement for the child but directed toward the parents is the best alternative way to advert a product for a young child. With such an advertisement the parents can analyse and see through the advertisement and can make a well decision if the product is good for the child or not. As an example we see something to play from Toys'R'Us and it is made to attract young children sitting in front of their television. Now the child just sees the fabulous design of the thing and wants it immediatly. But if Toys'R'Us would make an advertisment for the parents it would also show the good funtionality and the safety that the thing brings or not brings. And then the parents can analyse that and not just buy it because the advertisment tricked the child with its design.",7
73,"My first point for allowing advertisment toward young children is that it doesn't matter if they watch it. The parents still have something like the last word. Children need to ask their parents to buy the products for them so the advertisment towards them is close to useless, because the parents will think about that.
Secondly they often don't understand the advertisement. If there is a advertisement about something like a little bear, children of age two wouldn't understand any word.",7
74,"In conclusion it can be clearly said that the advertising tries to influence the young children to make them dependent to their products. This is not good at all because we all are being influenced by something we don't want to, which is sort of doing harm to someone. The young children can't do anything against this process and in my opinion this is where also the profit-organized businesses should stop.",7
75,"On the one hand, children are constantly confronted with all sorts of advertising, as they watch television. Ads that are directed toward people their age would be better for their intellects than those that are meant for adults only. To keep them safe from sexual and violent subjects, it would be helpful to show the right ads on channels they watch.
On the other hand, chidren aged two to five should generally not be allowed to watch television regularly. If parents are responsible with their childrens' time management, there is no need for TV companies to show ads directed toward them.
It is important to mention that children do have a say in what their parents buy them. Having seen an interesting ad about a toy for example can have them begging for it. 
But actually, those children are not customers yet. They don't have a say in what their parents buy them. Therefore, advertising about toys and other childrens' products should also be directed toward parents, since they are potential customers - not the children themselves.",7
76,"If young children should be the target of advertisments is a very crucial and debatable topic. People that are against it tend to say that already at an very young age children get influenced by big advertisment companies. The children can often be easily manipulated and the resulsts are that the parents need to spend money on products that the children mostly don't need and the joy won't even last for long, cause these children same as the adults will fall for newer and better products when they come out and they won't be able to have enough and wil never stop craving for bigger, better and newer products. children shouldn't be influenced and manipulated at this very young age, they should be playing outside, socialize and being educated and not a consumer victim at the age of 5. By not knowing what exactly it means to buy, spend money and own a product those children that are targeted will get a bad understanding of earning, owning and buying. On the other hand we live in a consumer world where our needs get mostly fullfilled by products which is debatable if it's good but thats how we work. So shouldn't those children be confronted with the true World at an young age the learn how to live with it. They could develop skills and a feeling at an very young age what advertisments really are and getting a better understandning of products and advertisments. In a faster grwoing world it seems logical that children should be confronted with the ups and downs and start to learn about them and how to  live with them. Nevertheless children should be allowed to be children to play learn and have fun and not being influenced by big companies at the age of four. What those companies do is brainwashing by using nice colors, sounds and children to play in the commercials. At this young age the Children don't have an understanding of what they're watching and that what they're watching should make them buy stuff. Because of this and many other reasons I highly discourage the advertisment of young children aged two to five.",7
77,I agree with this following statement. Because I see that the young children are vicitims from elder people who want only power over the children. Those advertising can influence their mind and how they will think and act later. Maybe the advertising is furious and scary. I also think that a young child doesn't need a advertising for chose his toys or dolls.,7
78,"Firstly, many advertising spots are about pruducts which adults or teenager would buy and not toys or something children would like to see. They have no idea for what are the producs for and so the advertising makes no sense.
Secondly, children often believe what an andult said without doubt. So they also believe what the advertising says and that is often overacted and unrealistic. On the other hand, young children will not know the topic of every single spot after they switch off the television. 
Furthermore, advertising is made for manitpulate people that they buy a product. Children are easier to influence and they believe every nonsens which the advertising says. So it is dangerous to give the children wrong knowledge or destroy childrens imagination. ",7
79,"Advertisement is something we see every day. We may come across it at the railway station, on the radio, while browising the internet or just simply while watching TV. It became something so common that we no longer question it. But the advertisements have reached such an extent that there are now some targeted specifically towards children at the age of two to five years. But thats not an issue, or is it?
Childern that age cant buy the products anyways, so why make a fuss about it? In the end its the parents that has to work for the money to buy the products and its the parents who then also buy the products. So the advertisements targeted at children are just other means to reach the parents. Its kinda like putting the sweets right at the cash register at the super market. They try to put the parents in a situation where they have to buy the products because their child wouldn't stop talking about it or maybe the child would even start crying or throw stuff around in anger at its parents. This strategy uses the bond between parents and children to reach its means. And I would even go that far as to say that they dont even care if they destroy these bonds. Children left mentally scarred just because they had some silly fight with their parents over a toy or whatever. Also small children are easily influenced by what they see or hear and some might argue that its good not to confront them with the bitter truth about life but telling them pretty lies might be just as bad.
I dont have any problems with the advertisement of products for young children, but I think its wrong to manipulate children. Those Advertisements should rather be directed towards the parents. So I think its bad to make advertisements specifically for children.",7
80,"The question if television advertising for young children should not be allowed, is a question that concerns many people. There are parents who do not want their children to see it because if the children see those advertisements, they could be influenced in a way they don't even understand yet. They don't realize that in advertisements, everything is showed that it looks more beautiful as it is, and that mostly the product isn't as good as in the advertisement. 
But another question is, why shouldn't it be allowed, because young children shouldn't be watching television all the time, because it's not good for them. A child should be outside playing with other children to get more social, so the advertisment in the television shouldn't bother them at all, because they don't see it so often. But sadly, it isn't normal, that a child isn't allowed to watch television when it wants so it's a reasonable doubt if they could change their behaviour or something else because of the advertisment. I think the main problem is, that the children grow up as careless consumers when they see it, a consumer that doesn't care if he really needs the product or not and in the world there are enough of this specific kind of people. For example, a child sees a machine that can make bubbles, and is so fascinated of it, that it wants the machine no matter what. Of course the child is too young to think about the money that it costs and the water that it consumes but I think if a child is used to get things without thinking about the reasons to get it, or the use it has, it will have the behaviour as well in the future. 
Another aspect is, that the parents could be even more stressed, because their child wants all the things he sees in the advertisement. We can all imagine a young boy crying on the floor because he didn't get his water pistole he saw in the television. And if this happens a few times in a week, because the boy sees another thing he wants in an advertisment, it could be really stressfull for the parents. But there is also a good thing that advertisments for young children can do. They can show products that are healthy, for example a snack made out of fruits. If a child sees this he might change his preferences in eating, and instead of eating a chocolate bar, he'll eat a bar made out of fruits. In a time where there are a lot of people with too much weight, this is a good way to change the eating behaviour in the young ages.
In conclusion, there are a lot of negative aspects in advertisement for young children, but there are positive aspects too. For me, I don't think they are really usefull, because all they do is create a society that consumes too much, and in addition they can create problems between the parents and the children. But the most important thing is, that a child isn't at home all the time watching television, because the social contact is really important in this age.",8
81,"If we watch television today, it's full with advertising for the newest volumenshampoo, the most comfortable car, the best accurancy. Yes, advertising is every where in our time now, but in television it has the greatest influence, because you see it again and again. Adult people can better decide between the bullshit and useful things in advertising. But how does it look by young children? They believe what they see. They think, that they all need to have from the advertising. Imagine an advertising for the new Barbiecastle. The little girl watch it and thinks ""wooow"", I need this. She wants that her parents buy it for her,  the parents say now and she gets very angry and sad. But I have to say, there are other parents, who want a happy child  and so they buy it. The problem is now, that the child think it gets everything. It shouldn't be like that. In childhood, the human brain learns very fast. Kids explore the world they live in. But if we imagine that a lot of these young children spend their time with watching advertising, learning the advertisnig spells by hearth and thinking always to it. Its shocking. Kids should go out and play with other children. These are reasons why I'm really against directed television advertising for young children.",8
82,"Advertising is a controversial topic. There are different opinions about what kinds of advertising should be allowed and at what point it should be banned. For big companies, there are different methods to advertise their products. One of this method is the television advertising directed toward young children. In the following I will describe arguments for and against these kinds of advertising.
A first and strong argument for the ban of this kinds of advertising is that the goal of the advertising is to play with a children's feelings. They give them the feeling that they need something, which, in fact, they do not need. 
Children are also not able to understand the goal of advertising like adults do. From this point of view, the advertising directed toward young children is irresponsible and therefore it should not be allowed.
But there are also arguments for not banning this kinds of advertising. Even if the children want to buy a product they saw in an advertising, there are the parents who decide if the child can have the product or not.
For children it is also important to learn that they can not have everything they want to have.  
In my opinion there is no reason to ban television advertising directed toward young children. In the end it is the  parents job to teach their children that they can not have everything they want to have. This is an important lesson in life.    ",8
83,"Advertising is a part of television. Any child who is waching television will watch advertising. Today in the 21th. century is advertesing a part of society. It's not just in televison.  
Chlildren have also a right to know what they could by or what is possible to buy. Even if they don't have pocket money, they could ask their parents to buy them the things which they have seen on television. Young children could also have fun while they're watching the advertising. Most of the advertising are made funny and don't just informate about the product. For example advertising for toys is made funny that the children want to play with it. Then the children will ask their parents for the toys. If there aren't advertisings for toys most of the children wouldn't know about them and their parents would have to search for them specific in the internet or in a toy shop. With the helping Advertising they know what and where to buy it.
But if you look at this theme in an other context, you would agree that so young children can't decide by their own what they need and what's good for them. In this context, advertising can manipulate young children realy good, because they don't have that much expirience to think carefully about the advertising.
I think that television advertising directed toward young children ( aged two to five) should be allowed. When I was a young child I liked to see the television advertising to know which new toys are in shops to buy. Sometimes I get one of these toys from my parents. But I think also that young children can't think about the advertising carefully what's tho goal of the advertising. They can be easyly manipulated by it. At the end their parents have to think about it and decide if they would buy something of the advertising for their children. ",8
84,"Advertisings in general do occupy a big aspect in our daily lifes. There are uncountable forms of ardertisings and we are getting confronted with advertisings everywhere we go, at any time. Commeicials on television are very intense because they consume ones attenion by stimulating multiple humen senses, such as ones eyes and ears. Therefore children can be easily influenced by tv-commercials because they react according to their stimulatings and feelings. Advertisings on television which are specificially created to reach children, often include edits that are supposed to manipulate the young audience. Children are easy to persuade and are likely to believe false promisings that are used in advertings to sell a product. One problem of the manipulation is that companies do present an unrealistic image to children, so kids may start believe in things that dont't actually exist in the real world, beacuse they have seen it in a commercial. Parents do also suffer from the specialized advertisisings, beacuse children will beg their parents to by a certain product as long until they will either buy it ore have a mental breakdown. 
Even though that commercials for young children may cause some stress-situations or aren't very ideal for the kid's education, the advertisings on television should not be prohibited. Children should get used to commecials and learn how to deal with daily advertising as soon as possible. Parents also need to take the responsibility and educate their kids about commercals and the way how to react to them.
 ",8
85,"TV advertaisemetent has boomed in the last few years. More and more also young children are directed by advertaisement with the goal to provocate their needs for buying a having new things. But should Television advertisisng directed towards young people  be forbidden?
A pro-argument to the prohibition is that young children, don't have the ability to form a personal opinion yet. They learn and grow by seeing, hearing and listening. That's why they are easy victimes and ""clients"" for the advertisment. They are powerless against what they hear, see and listen to and believe therefor everything. 
On the otherhand, young children don't have the possibilties to buy new things on their own. They are looked and ""controlled by their parents"" who, in the end, have the decision over how to spend the money. So advertisement for young Children doesn't always make sence. 
An other arguement is, that children stand under the influence of advertisement growing up and that this can have influence on their lifes later on, such as the way they buy and think about the world, The advertisement can also misslead the Children's interpration of happiness and what really counts in life. They will associate happines and success with materialistic stuff andalways having the newest things.
I pointed out more reasons to prohibid advertaisement for young childrenen, but what I think is, that it doesn't make a difference and that it's hard to stop advertasient. Young Children will always stand under influences of the outside praising and telling things and somehow they have to learn to deal with it. In my opinion what really counts it, that parents transmit and teach the children the right ways of living and interprating things, also telling them that not everything we see and hear is true. Children should grow up learing what really counts and not let themself be influeneced by what the outside world and the trends say so much. I Therefor say no, it doesn't make sence to forbid advertaisement and that if there are people who don't like their children to watch advertisement on TV, than they shouldnt let them watch T",8
86,"As more and more content is brought to our television, also the audience has changed compared to the last century. 
Children frequently watch TV already in a young age. This circumstance is used by private channels to  address their advertisement not only to adults but especially to toddlers.
The question therefore not only is why the channels do so, but also if they should be allowed to.
With the ads tlevision gains a lot of money, so the more advertisement, the better. Ads for children usually contain  toys or the latest series or films to watch. When the children see those ads they make their parents buy them these toys and are willing to watch even more TV. Like this the enterprises and the channels gain a lot of money.
But what about the children? Why should advertisement be bad for them?
They are influenced already at age two to five to buy anything they see and have no real relation to the product they want to have as they don't think about it like they would do in a shop.
In addition to that they will watch even more TV,which is according to several studies bad for the child's mental development as it does not have a sense for fantasy or thinking itself. 
In my opinion advertisement towards children should not be allowed as they are being influenced by it and don't learn about a toy's value. In the ads there are many adjectives like ""fantastic"", ""awesome"" or ""brand-new"" that tell the child that the product was almost perfect, so that the child does not choose it's toys by it's own preferences but by the way it was promoted.
Another big issue is the way that toys are promoted. Today almost every brand has toys for boys and girls. Thereby the boy's products are blue or black and the girl's pink and white. In the ads there are also always only girls playing together or boys, but there seem to be no more toys for bothb to play with. Like that the children are already confronted with gender stereotypes that are neither right nor have a place in our modern society. 
 As a conclusion I can say that ads for children only have bad influences on them and should not be allowed, as they transport the wrong ideals and stop the children of thinking themselves.",8
87,"
Television advertising is a big topic nowadays. You can't watch TV without loads of spots about products you schould buy. Even kids get involved in this kind of manipulation. So there is the question, if this should be allowed and what consequences could be the result of it.
Young people always are more manipulative than adults. Often they don't realize what is fake and what is real and that is the thing the advertising companies use for their sucsess.They show the kids a fake world with everything they dream about. So the kids get manipulated and they wanrt to have all the bveautiful things they see in the televison. Especially very young children are in volved in this problem, They can't judge the situation and don't see the real reasons and the conmpanies behind the great and fantastic advertising-world
You could say that this is a problem of the parents because they have to look after the young children and should decide what they see and what they don't see. But  how can you protect your kid from all this advertisment? It's nearlly everywhere and sometimes also very hidden.
In my opinion it shouldn't be allowed to make advertisment in TV for young kids.
In today's Society it is all about having things and wear clothes with the right brands.
Kids learn this behaviour nearly sinse they've been born. And this shouzld be stopped. Kids have to grow up with the kown of the right values and advertising in TV desstroys that.   
 
",8
88,"Young people can't understand that advertises aren't real or show things which are not as right as they see it. A child can't protect itself from television advertising. It will be influenced by the things said and doesn't understand that it doesn't need the things etc. 
Also, a child that age is normally accomanpied by its parents. But parents aren't able to watch every show with their child or to basically be there every minute. It is possible that the child will be afraid after what it has seen during the advertises. Other emotions are possible too, how should the parents know it comes from the advertisements on TV? 
Another problem is the inability of a child to draw a line between realitys and fiction. The advertisements may confuse it some more or promises things which can't be fulfilled for the child. So in the end, the child may be unhappy or sad because its parents can't fulfill its dreams or aren't able to buy the things. The main aim of products is the happiness of their buyers.
On the other hand, the market for products for children is really big. Enterprises have to have the right to promote their products or they will not have the chance to grow. Enterprises are as important as children for our future and they cannot survive if they aren't able to sell their products beacause of missing advertising. There is no other possibilty than to do television advertisements because you can be sure that people, especially children will watch it. 
Moreover, when it is forbidden to do advertisements on TV for children aged 2 to 5, where should you draw the line? Not all people can understand the meaning of advertisements and react to it like child. When you start to not allow advertisements for children, you will end up with forbibben advertisments for adults. As I already said, companies need to promote their products and that is not possible without TV advertising.
Also, it isn't the companies obligation to protect the children from the bad thing in the world. It is the exercise for their parents and if they allow their children to watch TV, they know there will be adverts. Enterprise shouldn't be punished for ""missing"" parents.",8
89,"Advertising for young children can be damaging to those because they tend to listen to their ""stars"" on the televison but on the other hand young children do not have the rights or money to buy those products in a shop or online.These children can easy be manipulated by the televsion, therefore they need an older person to buy it for them. Parents do want there children to be happy and might buy those products but they are very expensive and just for the moment since later on the children grows up and does not need it anymore. Parents should decide themselfs if a young children really needs these products or if they just want if because the ""televison said it"". If the advertising is inaprobiate or not desinged for the young crowd it should not be allowed anyway because they can heavily inflict the mental state of the children and manipulate them to do wrong things or buy illegal products.Good advertising is rare but effective since they can produces well desinged products which makes the children happy or maybe is good for their evolution by learing certend things by using the product. Also the parents should not left the children to long alone on the television because they might lag the skill to interact with other children later on which got attention from there parents and learned how to interact or make friends from them a bit by watching them or listen to them. Childrens need those social interactions to grow up normally and should not be damaged by any electronical media like advertising in their early years. Also it could make the children addictet to certend advertising or television. In the end i agree with this statement since the mental and social damage a Television advertising is to big and problematic for young children without their own mind since they get less attention from parents or other ""real"" personÂ´s, do not interact with other children or get addicted to certend products.

90,"So, I think it's save to assume that small children that haven't even reached the age of six aren't even remotely as accustomed to our influential world, especially when talking about how advertisement and other simmilar means aiming to make profit try to manipulate the consumer. So my first thought would be to say that it's really a good thing to not allow big companies to manipulate children. But then again you have to start wondering. If a child really, really wants something badly, what does it do? I mean, small children don't have any money. They don't go into the next toy store to by the newest play set. No, they go and ask their parents to by it for them. And that's the important point for me. Yeah, children are easy to manipulate, but it doesn't help the company to gain any profit as long as the child's parents don't by what was shown in the advertisement. So in my opinion it's not the ""evil television"" or ""greedy companies"" that are the problem, but instead it's bad parents. The child didn't decide to by something because the child can't decide to do so. The parents are the ones who in the end go into a store and get the object in question, so it's also the parents' responsibility to make sure that they don't by something that, in their opinion, is not something their child should possess. It's not the advertiser that's to blame here but they. Now some people might argue that while a child won't be able to by something for themselves they can still scream, cry, fight, and generaly make their parents' live hell. And then again,I don't think that's something the advertiser should be blamed for. The parents have to make sure their child is raised in a way that teaches them propper maners, and while every child will probably try to get something by being loud at least once they have to be taught that this is not hiw live works. You can't and you won't get everything you want right away, possibly you won't ever get what you want. ",9
91,"In the one hand, there is to be said that little children have a great impact on their parents, so when they realy want something they saw somewhere parents often buy the product. They are in a way manipulated by their children. It is then unfair tu push the children to manipulate their parents for buying an article seen in an advertisement.",9
92,To bring it on point: Young children are very easy to get influenced and companies know that. It is the parents challenge to talk to their children about that. In my opinion this still doesn't justify the companies advertising. I think it should not be allowed because these children already get to see many toys in the stores and it just brings more pressure for the parents. ,9
93,"On the other hand, there are also many reasons why it should not be allowed.
Children in the age of two to five donÂ´t have an own opinion. They are influenced very fast by media, people or Television advertising. Children can not understand that an object of the advertising is not that good in real life how it is descriped in the advertising. They donÂ´t know that the advertising shows an idealised picture of the product and want to have it, although it is not that good in the reality.
As well children havenÂ´t got so much money. They only have their pocket money and the money that them was given. But children donÂ´t own their own money, because they donÂ´t work. So it is not fair to let them buy the things of the advertising, because the children should not spend all of their money. Children should rest money for the future. The kids will be disappointed if they buy an object and it isnÂ´t so how it is descriped and they will regret that they bought it. ",9
94,"I disagree, but I can understand why you could agree with it. First of all you can influence children much easier and as a result they then want to have this product, but on the other hand they don't have any money to buy it. So they have to go to their parents and ask them. Their parents should be aware of manipulation and really think really sceptically about buying this product. Because they lived their hole life with advertisment and its manipulation that they should know that they only try to manipulate you. A small child isn't aware of this and the bigger it is the better. There are some parents who can't handle this situation and want to forbid the advertisment toward young children. But then we have an empty slot in the advertisment and they are going to fill this empty slot with a diffrent davertisment It is very difficult to make a restriction to prevent it, but the easiest way to prevent it is: not letting watch television or look at the newest catalogue about for exemple LEGO. Of course you can't prevent your own child to look at a poster outside but you can take certein steps to minimalise it. As a good parent, who can handle money, I don't think you're gonna have a big problem. But to do all of this you have to be able to know about this problem  and you should not buy blind certein products for your child. Please don't missunderstand me, I don't want to say you shouldn't buy any advertised product for your child but you have to think about that and decide by yourself.",9
95,"Young children don't really know what it means to buy something, they don't even know what money is.
When they see something in the televison, they want to have it, becaus the people who are using it are very happy. Children can't think of the future as we can (e.g. when the toy is broken or when they are too old for it). Money isn't important to them and they can't imagine what a specific price conectet with a product means, wether it's a fair price or not. They aren't able to connect all those things togheter.
Young children aren't allowed to buy things by themselves, so advertising directed towards them shouldn't be allowed. The parents have to buy all the things for them and they have to decide what they want to buy, not their children. Parents have to do a lot for their children. The last thing they want is an annoying son or daughter who wants someting unnecessary and expensive.
A reason against this statement would be that the people who make those television advertising have to pay a lot of money for that and that they somehow have to earn money with their business. It's a good strategy to advertise directly toward young children, because they are easy to convince and nobody can say ""no"" to such a cute little person.",9
96,"Therefor the parents should be in charge of what a child needs and what should be bought. And directing all this advertising towards the children only makes it more difficult for the parents to raise the rational, critical thinkers we all want to be with in our society.",9
97,"You can look at this statement in a lot of different ways. Firstly, let's look at why these commercials shouldn't be allowed: Many children in that age don't understand the principal of buying something. The can't quite grasp yet that they can't get everthing for free. Secondly, children can be manipulated quite easily. They belive almost everything, especially when it comes on TV or an adult tells it to them.
Now we will look at why these commercials should be allowed: At the end of the day, it's not the child that buys the toy, it's their parent. It is the responsibility of the parent not to buy the child every single toy that comes up on the TV screen. If the parent doesn't buy everything in the first place, the child will learn and will not always beg for more. And surely, children can be manipulated very easily, but so can adults. Look at all commercial for womens undergarment, for example Victoria's Secret: Just by putting beautiful women in your underwear and putting them on huge billboards, millions of women drag their husband to your shops to spend a lot of money. This shows it is even worse with adults.
In my opinion, childrens commercial should be allowed, because it's responsbility of the parents, and they are as naive as their children.    ",9
98,"Personally me, I can see the problem in spaming those children with television advertisments to make use of them. The children are so young but they actually already get to know the preassure of manufacturers. The television advertisments give them a feeling that they have a lack of something, beacause they don't have, what the children in the television are having. Obviousely not everyone needs such things to be happy but an advertisment always looks so nice to young children and the people in the advert always seem to be so happy so that they want to experience this feeling themselves.
It is also kind of stressfull for the parents. For example, when you have a child which is five years old and it comes shopping with you, it maybe starts to scream out loud in public just because it saw something that was recently in an advert. If you can't stop your children crying you maybe ponder to buy the object, just to keep your children's mouth shut.",9
99,"Nowadays there are many companies which advertise their products over the television. Many of those are advertisements about shampoos or a new parfume or something like that. A new trend which came up, is to advertise products toward young children. Most of them are toys. 
To tell whether it's  bad or good to do this kind of advertisement we have to list the pros and the cons.
One thing which would be in favour of the advertisements is that children get to know which products there are. They can tell their parents that they would like to have that new toy which they saw in the television. That would be a way how parents wouldn't waste money on things their children don't even want. Instead of buying their kid something that will never be used, they can make their child happy. 
Now that we talked about the pros, let's talk about the cons.
Many of the products advertised in the television are either useless or over-priced. The ""manipulate"" the children so that their parents will buy them the new toy. 99% of the time it's only about making money. The companies make their advertisements as cool as possible so that many children go to their parents and tell them that they want the product. It's hard for parents to say no to young children. They don't want the kid to be sad or to think that they're bad parents so they eventually just buy it. 
Children of this age can't decide whether they need this new toy or not. They see the advertisement in the television and decide upon that if they want it or not. Young kids don't ask themself if they will play with it more than once or twice. The part of their brain which is responsible for the critical thinking is not as developed as the brain of an adult. 
After talking about the pros and cons i would like to tell you about my own opinion.
In my opinion advertising toward young children is another way for companies to make money off of young children. I do think that it shouldn't be allowed since it either has as a result that kids are mad at their parents or that parents have to waste their money even if they're living from hand to mouth. Many young couples which have young children don't have that much money to buy their kids every expensive toy they see on the television. It doesn't really have a good side for the parents. The problem is that economie doesn't work like that. Money is all that it is about.",9
100,"There are also children who are influenced by the advertisements in another way. These children see them and then, they want all of the toys and harrass their parents to buy them. But it's the parents job to make their child understand, that it can't get everything it wants and to be carefull about not making it spoiled.",10
101,"First of all you can say that children aged between two and fived do not have that complex progress of will like we do as adults or young adults. They see the advertisement, like the toys that are pictured and with the next episode of Spongebob it is no longer interesting for them. Additional to that the children are not the ones who can buy these products in the normal stores because in the most cases they will only go shopping with their parents.
But actually advertisment that is driectly directed to the children can somehow influence them in their future consumer behaviour. The advertisemnt and the way the parents treat their childrens wishes could optimise or make their former consumer behaviour even worse. If a kid gets everything it wants, it will possibly buy everything it wants as an adult too and gets selfish. Additional to that there is some kind of social pressure. The parents of the children, who are directly confronted with the wishes of their children, probably can not afford the toys. The comparism kids do about toys puts a thirtend social pressure on the parents and could also be an indicator of wealth in society. The advertisement made for children is also kind of dangerous because children can be teached wrong moral rules or they can not estimate the symbolism or clishees the advertisement often uses.",10
102,"It is commonly known that these days, television overall has a big influence on young children. There is a risk that they will not able to distinguish the invented world from reality. that means that as soon as they see an advertisement trying to sell toys they will think it is essential to have one as well. In a way companies can use advertisement to manipulate the viewers. But that is no new thing. The difference to adult advertisement is that parents these days are often spoiling their kids. If a toddler comes and asks them to buy a toy, they will be more willing to do so than to buy themselves a pair of trousers or a new television.",10
103,"Young children are not able in differentiating what they really need and what is good for them from what is not useful or fun at all. Neither are they able to decide if buying that toy is worth it regarding to the quality. 
On the other hand children have to make their experiences in life and first of all learn so many lessons in advertising as well. Kids aged two to five cannot really get what is said to them in television. What happens only is that they are like: ""Oh I really want that"". 
Children these days are watching TV more than they are playing in the woods. Making them seeing all these things like toys, movies or something which are showed off in the best way possible would make the situation worse. They may even spend more time in front of a display.
But because of that trend that young kids want to watch more TV marketing functions on television. ",10
104,"First of all as I already said kids in this age are easy to manipulate which makes kids just a tool for the companies to get the money from the parents. The children see things in the TV and start crying about how bad they want to own this toy. On the other hand its good to show that there are oppurtunities in which the parents could invest. Not every advertising which is shown on the TV towards children (two to five years old) is manipulative and some are maybe helpful or may cause a better influence on the child. But in generel the companies don't seem to care at all what people buy or how healthy and good for kids it is, all they see is the money they make by showing TV advertising towards kids this age. Most of those advertisings are just really colorful and full of sounds and jingles which stuck in the heads of children. I don't really think it may cause damage for kids to watch those kind of advertisings but I'm not truly of the opinion that its helping in any way too. I remember when I was child I always wanted the big toys to be mine no matter how expensive they were and I knew I never had to pay for them in any way because I knew my parents would get maybe get me them. Most of the time I didn't get them but sometimes it really helped and they got me those toys I wanted. And all of this just because I saw loud and colorful advertisings which showed toys or other stuff which wasn't that good as expected in real life then. Sometimes I was even a little bit disappointed by the toys I got then. The advertisings mostly just come up with new stuff every year e.g. for christmas. Every year the same: 2 moths before christmas time starts they keep showing advertisings towards children in the age of two to five. And basically its the same toy they were showing 4 years ago just a little bit different. 
Basically there is no real problem with showing advertising to children of this age but I just don't seem to like it somehow because I think its a ""trap"" which snaps every year again. And its not only about the Christmas time, is it?No, its about the whole year. Everyday there are hours of advertising and hours of the shown advertisinge towards kids. Children who are allowed to watch e.g. 2 hours of TV a day always come across advertising. Like theres no real chance to get around it. ",10
105,"First of all, advertising is a way of manipulation. Especially children can be manipulated very quickly. Advertising supports our consumer society and shows these young children things they want, but don't really need, at a very young age already. Although children do not have the money to buy the products they see on television themselves, they will want their parents to buy it for them and be jealoous of their friends who have it. Children are not able to recognize what they really need and what they already have at that age. Parents often report of having toys that are never played with at their house.",10
106,"As young children tend to believe everything they get told, they are very likely to be influenced. This is used by many companies through television advertising to make them want something. The pressure of needing something in order to have fun or to be cool already confronts these young children. And if a child doesn't get what it wants, it fastly gets frustrated and sad. This might be caused by the famous phenomenon, which says that children never can get enough toys. On the other hand some might say that it's the fault of the parents as well, who didn't teach their children enough to be happy with a couple of toys. The fact that children aged two to five normally didn't develop that much yet. So they do not realise that something isn't necessary to have even though they are interested in it. Another argument for these television advertisement could be the money these television channels need. During childs programm on television there is always some advertisement. When a child watches a childs series it it understandable that it is normal to show advertisements which are appropriate for children and not to show adults advertisements. Some television channels need these advertising companies to support their channel and to make sure they are still able to show their content in the future. ",10
107,"First of all, it could be a problem if the children don't watch television. In todays society it's sure quite impossible but some parents do still have a quite conservative mind and don't want their children to watch television. 
Secondly, children can be manipulated very easily. So if they see an advert, which is for sure an exaggeration of the actual product, the children will scream and shout until they get this, probably very expensive, product.
On the other hand it's a quite good idea for kids to see all the new products they could learn with. Like this, the producers don't have to wait until a miracle happens and the kids or their parents will see the toy in the shop. 
Also it could be a good way to teach the kids that they can never have everything they want. Sure, for this the parents have to be quite strict, but if they are like this I'm sure the child will grow up an adult which has a lot of self-esteem.
Last but not least, todays children have so many difficulties to accept a no. So many parents would do and buy everything for their kids and like this the child wants the parents to buy everything they see in the television. Even if they will play just one time with this toy because after they already want another one.
In conclusion, I can say that I am against television advertising directed towards young children.For me, the best argument against these kind of adverts is that the children can be manipulated this easily. Grown up know this for sure and that's why they do this kind of advertising. And because of that it shouldn't be allowed.
",10
108,"It is an other situation if children can see this kind of advertising. The short video clips in the televison are special made that they manipulate the mind of the childrens, and they want to have this toys. After the program the children search the parents and ask them to buy this stuff. Imagine your own young child have those wishes, would you ignore them? Exactly that is the reason why the advertising for children is a such bad buisness. The people who works in the television get richer and the parents get poor. ",10
109,"Firstly the children do not know anything about money or the even the world and how it is working. It will see the advertisement and will not stop crying until it gets the toy. At first it will probably forgetit but a advertisement will come a serveral time during a day on TV. So the children sees the toy and can not stop thinking about it. And this can happen with plenty of other advertisements.The parents have no choice and they will buy the product for the baby so it can stop asking and can be happy.
Another point is that children are in their growth process. If it gets confronted with advertising daily after every TV programe thechildrenwants then everything and if the parents are not strict it will do that in its teenager years too and then probably for thewhole live. Children have to be educated thatif they want somethingtheyhave to dothings before they can even imagine of getting something.
The last point is that advertising for children is unnecessary and it is just a psychological way to earn money which is really childish. A child watches TV to learn the language or to understand the situation in the TV programs,not to get attracted bya toy.",10
110,"Television is very popular in our generation and in every house you find one or more. For many families its a possibility to give their children something to do. But children cant learn to do something alone und so they arent interested in plays for their age. I think children aged two to five should not be allowed to watch TV, because it isnt good for a right education and their own development. In our society everything is used with media and you need it to live. Many parents make the mistake also with their children. They grow up with the same media problem and learn in young age how to use it. Another point is, what you see on the TV. A few years ago you had the possibility to watch series, which are also for young aged children. Nowadays you have the modern serien with guns and sexual things. It isnt save to watch TV to five years and also the ages after. Parents never really know, if its right what their children watch. We have many adults, who havent work, sit at home an do nothing. They sit the whole day at home and watch TV. Adults, as parents, are like an idol for the children and show with their lifestyle whats right and whats wrong. When young aged children to have the possibility to watch TV, you could imagine in which familiy the child grow up. The first ages are the most important years for their future life and in this time you have the best possibilities to teach them. In age from zero to five and also after they forget nothing what they have done. So in my opinion its the best way to give them something to do if you havent enough time for your childre, but the baddest way in the future of the children and not very ethical for the education.  For chiildren aged two to five it should not be allowed and the years after only a very short time and very strict.",11
111,"I would say that itÂ´s right to allow children to use the television because of the learn effect but IÂ´am not agree by let a child do what he/she want to, because just like I meantioned at the beginning in the television youÂ´ve got so many options by switching form one channel to another that you can lose the feeling of the time and start to spend to much time by watching it.
My opinion is that itÂ´s from familiy to familiy different because you canÂ´t tell your children to stop whatching television if you spend the whole time by doing it and in this point it isnÂ´t important how old these children are.I would meantion too, that the television is a medium which have a big might at which is able to form the way a human think and if a child start with young age whatching television it will be have more effect od the children ",11
112,"The question if young children should not be allowed to watch TV is not that easy to answer, there are a lot of pros and cons.
At first young people are much more easy to influence than adults so they may think that everything told on TV is real. On the other hand children are often very interested in things they donÂ´t know and they can also learn a lot while watching TV and thatÂ´s quite a good chance. 
But in this young age itÂ´s not neccessary to watch TV there are so many things they can do to learn and know whatÂ´s going on in the world. But sometimes itÂ´s just nice for the parentes to have a break and most of the childen like to watch TV and so the adults can do what they like and donÂ´t alway have to do something with their children.
The last point is that there arenÂ´t only nice and unscary movies on TV so childs can be scared or shocked by what they see.
At least i think itÂ´s okay when children watch TV but the parentes have to check what and how long they watch. There should be a limit which every family can discuss on their own, so the children know that they arenÂ´t able to sit in front of the TV the hole day. I think that it is important for the process of growing up and the individuality of everyone, to go out, meet people, make friends and so on and thatÂ´s not possible if you are just inside and never leave the house which is a risk when you have nothing to do and so just watch TV.",11
113,In the end I can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 2-5 must be allowed to interfier with that. In the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life.,11
114,"In my opinion it is good idea that television for children from two to five shouldnÂ´t be allowed, because so the most parents are going to do more outside activities with their kids, which would cause an better relationship to the people outside. The kids could learn more about the inviroment or get new friends. in the real life the kids will learn how to react in different situations, which they maybe canÂ´t handle with when they are just watching it on television. Most of the TV series now a days are not ideal for litte children from the age from two to five, because they can just see an situation but canÂ´t experience it in tzhe real life for theirselves. Maybe it is possible to find an compromise between watching TV in this age and getting advertised by the real life with real feelings and real situation where thy can learn from others how to react right.",11
115,"In conclusion I think that it isn't a bad thing, to let kids watch TV sometimes, not the hole day, but, as an example, some minutes per day or some hours each week, or somting like that. In my opinion, if the children watch the right kind of series and films, it teaches them more positive things than negative. So I personaly don't think there's a need to forbid children to watch television at a young age.",11
116,"The statement that children at the age of two to five should not be allowed to watch television is not easy to answer. There are many reasons why it should be allowed and many reasons why it should be forbidden.
Kids at the age of two to five are in a part of life in that humans learn a lot and create their own identity.
Televisionn could be a big help on the way to learn how speaking works. Today there are many TV-shows like Dora which are helping kids to handle different situations of life. But it is also important to learn skills like eating alone, go to toilet alone and so on. It is way better to learn together with your parents instead of learning alone in front of the television. Everybody knows how hard kids can be and if the parents need some freetime to calm down or something like that, the television would be a good point to give the kid something to do.
I think it would be a good compromise to allow kids watching TV but just a special type of TV-shows which are made for kids and maybe with a time limit of 1 hour per day.
I think it would be the best if the parents are finding a good balance between learning together with the kid and let the kid learn alone.
",11
117,"
All in all, I think it is the own problem of the parents if they let watching their children tv in such a young age. My opinion is that it is risky to let children watch television in a young age, because then they don't have to think by themselves and they just sit on the couch and watch straight forward. This means they could get physical and psychical problems, what could be incorrect.",11
118,"I think it should be allowed when they watch only an half an hour or something like that. But when they often watch television, they didn't play enough time outside or with friends. Sometime the television is something you can learn from. The parents should give them a timeline for example only one serie before they go to bed. The parents didn't watch telesivion so long too,because the kids think it's right what the parents do. I think when it's not be allowed the kids demonstrate with this and it's often hard to life when the kids are sad or something like that. The kids can often be angry when they watch to much television and watch the false series too. An other thing is that the kids very sad about it when the parents did'nt play with them and only watch television is bad for the parents too. It's okay when the whole family watch a movie at weekend night then they do something together and it's something that the whole family like. It's also okay to show the kids the news on television because to show whats happend in the world and that the kids learn something about the world. I think it's important to have time with kids and not with the television . At the end the parents say that is okay or not,but I think it's not bad when kids watch television but they need a timeline. ",11
119,In my oppinion it should be allowed for children to watch TV but not that often so they have enough time for using there freetime to gain experiences. Television adevertising directed toward young children should be allowed but parents should pay more attention on it. And I think not every child is watching TV that often so there are only a few with problems. ,11
120,"Everybody gets influenced by advertises. Espacially in the television advertises can trick people to buy the product even if the don't really need it. So most of the young children gets affected and are influenced by these tricks.
 There are lots of arguments against the television advertising toward young children. Young children can' recognize tricks of the producers so all they want is to buy the product. Due to the fact that the children want to have these product the parents are affected too. 
The children want it and they don't know if the parents have the necessary money but there is a positive aspect too. There are some products which has to be bought by the parents for example the clothes. So the parents have to be informed about the latest products for their children. It means that the consumers have to knoe which products are for their children and where you can buy it. 
another negative aspect is that the children might think if they see the advertisments they don't have good parents who buy them just boring stuff. When they see the latest Playmobil modell the only thought they have is ""I want it"" but the next Playmobil modell will be released in 2 weeks and the they want this. So for the parents its don' even possible to buy all things for their children.
My opinion is that the television advertising should be in the evening or in the late afternoon, so the parents see this advertises and the children don't get influenced, so the children can get new products but they don't want the latest of everything.",12
121,"At a young age, children do imitate and do things they get caught. Advertising is trying to convince the watcher. Young children have no experience to differ, what is good and whats not. So, they get taught about something, and grab this knowledge in a time where getting an opinion and make yourself an image of this world, is pretty necessary. Not ot forget advertisment is manipulating, not a positive word. 
But otherwise, advertising wants you to buy something, like products or services and kids from two to five years, probably wont have the financial force to execute these purchases. In that way advertising maybe ould not affect the situation negative in this way. And also a positive effect is, that the child does get an idea of the technical and engineering situation of the moment. How do products look like? What are you able to do with them? For example, how does the new iPhone look, what can you do with it? Well, thats not central in this case, because it is not directed towards young children, but it goes in this way. Children then also learn to differ what would I buy and what is not necessary.",12
122,"On the plus side of the television advertising can kids learn how many products excist. They see that teddybears excist in many different forms and colours. If they wouldn't see the promotion, they would think that the teddybears of themselves are the only one in the world.
But if the children see all those playtools they want to buy quite everything. In the storage they are crying because of the ""mean"" mum who don't want to buy something.
An advantage is that the kids have to learn beause of the advertising what are important and what are usless informations. They learn very fast that they can't guess everything. Like that the advertise helps the kids to think by themself. 
Enemies of the promotions says: ""The advertise has to much influence to the kids"". A child doesn't see just television advertising which is made for his age. It is very often confrontated with sloganes with bad influences. For example: If they see some promotion with pills to lose weight, they are asking the parents why some people take these pills. Like that they are confrontated with this beauty-force too early. ",12
123,"Children are very easy to influence. By showing them food, toys and other things that they like but do not already have, the chance is high that they try to persuade their parents of buying it for them. Furthermore, television for children is made to show them different stories and characters with which they can identify. Television advertising interrupts these stories and movies children are watching and with that, their concentration towards the story or storyboard. Showing the children more and more of toys that they do not even need, makes them addicted to it and has brainwash potential.
On the other hand, advertising is always on television, wether it is directed to children or not. In this case it would not be wrong to direct advertising especially to children instead of adults, it is even more interesting for them. Advertising can not only be found on television but all over the place. In many cases it is important to have the skills of reading to understand the meaning, which children of five years do not already have. With television advertising that includes the written and spoken words as well as pictures of the product, let's say of a barbie, children start to compare the letters and the voice and try to understand it. Through that, reading and auditive understanding are improved. The other advantage is clearly made for the toy and movie industry, which produces the products treated in the advertising spots. The consume-behaviour of children is totally different than the one of their parents. Children at an age of five can not really consider wether they need something very bad or not. If they have success with convincing their parents of buying the things they want, the industry can make a big success out of it.",12
124,"Television advertising is a very strong form of advertisement. The main problem with advertisments directed to children is, that it makes them want what is shown in the TV. Small children are very influencable so if they see a lot of TV advertisements made for children, they will annoy their parents by telling them: ""I want this!"",""I want that!"" They will become children who want to have everthing. When they are children, that aspect of personality isn't a big problem because their parents are setting borders for them. But the children won't stay children forever. They will get adults and have an own apartment. Thats when the TV advertisements really become a problem. That aspect of pereonality that has grown through watching TV will get the overhand and they are going to buy a lot of stuff they don't really need. That will cause them to live in poverty later in their life. Another bad aspect of television advertisements directed to children is, that there are not only children who watch TV. Other people will be annoyed by adverstisments for ""stupid child stuff"" and they are going to switch to another channel. So advertisments for children are not only bad for the children but also for the channel that sends those advertisements. The third an last bad aspect is, that it makes decisions even harder for children when they are young. If their parents tell them, they can spend a certain amount of money and the children want everything, they won't be able to make a decision in short time. The only good thing with advertisments for children is, that it shows them possibilities and sometimes, it makes them discover something they wouldn't know about if they didn't see the advertisement.",12
125,"But there is an other side aswell. By bringing small children in contact with television advertisements these kids will form such a strong mind that they for example laugh about other children if they don't have the newest doll or the newest shirt. This can then lead to bullying as soon as the kids get older. 
After having seen these advertisements these kids won't be able to form their own mind on what they like and what they don't like, they think because they saw this object in an advertisement it for sure has to be the best. With advertisements precisely directed towards these kids they will have even more reasons on why to watch television. Advertising something for children young aged will make it very hard for parents to explain to their children why they can't have everything they want. These kids will want to have everything they have seen on TV and think that it is normal to have this particular object.",12
126,Advertisments have an influence on everybody who is watching. The adult people are able to know how to work and live with these information. But young children maybe arenÂ´t able to see the difference between the shown world in the advertisments and the realitiy. They canÂ´t understand the task of advertisements and interpretate them in a wrong way. These wrong understandig can have a bad influense for there coming life. They maybe can understand from an advertisment about chocolate or other sweets that unhealthy food is good and makes happy. The advertisement gives the children no chance to get informed about the negative aspects of the products. They only shows the good and happy world you might have using the product. But also that is a problem. The children thing that if you use the product everything would change like in the advertisment. But that ist wrong and the children arenÂ´t able to understand that. ,12
127,One advantage of this advertisment is that the children are informed about their environment at a young age. They might know where the closest pharmacy is at and where they have to go in an emergency. But on the negative side the children get manipulated by the companies. They see an advertisment about some toy and emediatley want this toy. Their needs after material satisfaction gets bigger and bigger. Furthermore it is difficult for the parents when their children have many material wishes and they can't fullfill them. An other disadvantage is that the children want more electrical things through this advertisment and might forget to go and play outside. It's important for a child to meet friends and play with them some games like hide and seek. In fact the kids should explore the nature instead of the television. On the plus side the kids could develope their caracter earlier. For example they see some dolls in an ad and don't want them. But then they see some teddybears and want one for christmas. So the parents know what their child prefers and now they can get the perfect gift. But this would make the happiness of a child dependent of their material gifts. It shouldn't be a childs focus if they got this shoes or those shoes.,12
128,"We have to think about that these children that we are talkking about are in a very early period of their lifes. Children in this age can easily be influenced by their surroundings. Bad advertising can have bad influence on their further development. In extreme examples governments could even use ads to spread their thoughts to the youngest. As we see, the potential is huge. 
In our days electronic devices are more and more used by younger people. TV chanels use this fact to specificaly target these young people and sell their advertisment time to for example toy manufacturers. For them this time is litteraly a gold mine. As long as they makke their ads ""cool"" in a sence of showing how awsome their new toy is the kids will beleive them. The children also don't care if they allready own a simullar toy, they just see the newer and awsome one. Because of that kids do not learn to be happy with what they allready own. They usually don't ask themselfs about the nagatives of what is advetised. I would say that this is normal though.
This influencial power can and should be used in a positive way. Telling them about environment, solidarity and moral would be possile. It had to be packed into a good ad though. In that way the earlier mentioned potential would be used to teach important stuff to children. 
In my opinion advertising targeted towards young children is dangerous and should regularly be controlled by adults. However the possibilities are to big to just not use it and I really think this potencial has to be used.",12
129,"For every minus there is a plus. Sooner or later the children will see advertising in the television. It is better they see it, when they are young. They learn, that we can not have everything we want, and that is a very important aspect in life. The children have stuff to talk about. They can exchange what they saw, and who thinks what is cool. It also helps them to form their identity. They will recognize, what they like, and what not. And when they get something, that is not as it was in the advertising, they learn, that not everthing is like what it seems to be.",12
130,"Near to all TV shows, movies and so on, are interrupted by advertising. They can be good or bad, adventurous or stupid. 
The advertises are good for the business, the children see some sweets or a doll and the want to have it. They ask there parents to buy this stuff until they get it. Without television advertising many factories would be closed.",13
131,"Television advertising has got a lot of influence on our society. It gives us needs or wishes we should have. And since more than three quarter of the population owns a television, we cannot deny the big range of influence one single advertising can have on us. ",13
132,Advertising is a very big and important theme of today's society. Every brand or new thing tries to sell and promote their products through ads like television or internet. There are a lot of advertising that are in television for adults but influence a lot young children. ,13
133,"Television advertsing is a popular way to catch our attention. Young children also watch television which is why they get confrontated with the advertising too. This is a good thing for the people who advertise because if children see something they like they tell their parents and the parents buy it. Furthermore, they should get in touch with advertisments because if they want to watch television they have to watch the advertisings too. ",13
134,"Advertising is seen everywhere on the streets, on plackates, it is heared in the radio or read in a magazine or newspaper, finally is is also seen in the televison or in the cinema. ",13
135,First of all you have to think about the fact that we are dealing with children: there are some things which are different about advertisement for kids or for adults. You can influence kids more than adults with tv spots. If they see a toy in an advertisement break they` ll want to buy it. ,13
136,"Television advertisement has always been very important for different companies, but nowadays there are a lot more people watching television, including young children. A good advertisement can have a big influence on people and an impact on companies.",13
137,"Television advertisments are necessary for the television programm. Beyond the advertisments for children there are also advertisments for other ages. Not only to fill the gaps but also to pay high streaming prices, television stations are forced to show off brands in their advertisments. These short clips range from the luxury car you would like to own to some delicious chocolate. ",13
138,"Television advertising is key to a well functioning economy of a country. Billboards and newspapers are also an opportunity for  informing the population of one's country about upcoming and outstanding products. But it is the television which hasturned out to be most effective. In a by technology dominated society of 2017, people, even families spend a large amount of their day-time infront of a televsision. Watching TV whilst eating has become more than just normal, many families don't eat together so each of them can watch their TV-show. A company is eager to sell their products to as many people as possible. Therefore classic 'propaganda' and mouth to mouth propaganda are essential for an industry-branch to survive within the growing markets. By showing ads, people are confronted with the new or old products. Many may think about the products later on or think of them unconciously, without them noticing. The best ads are the most annoying ones. You for exp hear a song or see the beginning of the ad and already know which one it is. You think ugh not this one again, but that's the best reaction a person can have. Now the company knows that the ad is like 'branded' into one's brain. Ads are expensive, but bring in more money than they costed. A world without adverstising wouldn't work. And a TV-station simply cannot control how's watching TV. so ads for kids can't be removed easily just like that.",13
139,"Television advertising is a thing many of us hate. Nowadays advertising is to be found everywhere, no matter if you are in a Cinema or if you read the daily newspaper. television advertising is a very extrem topic. Because of the time most of us spend in front of a television every day and the amound of people possesing televisions, television advertising is a very attractiv way to prmote products. Therefore a lot of companies invest in television advertising, promoting their new or old product directed towards their aimed consumers.",13
140,"Many young children watch TV on a daily basis. Mostly they do not only watch series for the right age that leads to them watching television advertising. 
Of course,advertising is not bad in general but it could lead to arguments within the family. For example because the children want their parents to buy a new toy that they saw in the TV. The parents could easily get annoyed if their kid always asks for new thiongs to try. And as all of us know, advertising often does not promote the truth. That is another negative aspect because we, the consumers tend to believe anything that is told on TV and we spend a lot of money because we want our kids to be happy and we want them to have a childhood that is worth to be remembered.
Also many advertisements are not useful and distract children from learning things that are important. They may try what is shown and get hurt.",14
141,"The amount of televison kids watch these days, since the Tv was created is higher then before. Kids spent their whole time in front of the TV or other specific high-tech systems. Kids, especially young ones can be distracted by the advertisments and can believe everything said in a 3 minute Tv spot. For example the Advertisments where unrealistic content is shown, like things that are on paper or package start living and flying around, or animals like unicorns get real and run through the living room. Another point of view is that the kids spent too much time in front of the Tv in general. They stop spending time with friends or just watch spongebob with them. There are also special Ads which kids will always keep in their mind. The ones with violent content, half-naked women or a lot of action stay in their minds and afterwards in school, they tell friend about it of course. 
But ads are not always bad and inappropriate. Sometimes they just want to make us realize how good we have it to have a home food and just a family. This concept goes for example with the ""unicef"" Advertisments. Those show often poor kids without food and family. If little kids get such a message is questinable though. Another pro aspect for ads is that are able to learn something new any may they can understand just a little how the ""big world"" works. Different pictures make different and impressions and different impressions make a more interesting place to live on. 
One way or another the influence of television and Advertisments is bigger then we think. But as long as our kids use some of their short time between Shows  and Cartoons to go out to remember what the real world looks like, things still didnÂ´t hit the bottom",14
142,"But there is an other side aswell. By bringing small children in contact with television advertisements these kids will form such a strong mind that they for example laugh about other children if they don't have the newest doll or the newest shirt. This can then lead to bullying as soon as the kids get older. 
After having seen these advertisements these kids won't be able to form their own mind on what they like and what they don't like, they think because they saw this object in an advertisement it for sure has to be the best. With advertisements precisely directed towards these kids they will have even more reasons on why to watch television. Advertising something for children young aged will make it very hard for parents to explain to their children why they can't have everything they want. These kids will want to have everything they have seen on TV and think that it is normal to have this particular object.",14
143,"Nowadays television advertising is a very important marketing tool. They are made carefully and it is supposed to convince the audience to have a desire for the product they are advertising for. Ads can influence a person emotionally and inspire them easily. It's something visual and that's why people can fall for the ads even easier because we like to believe in what we see. 
Children like to spend time in front of the TV and watch cartoon all day. Certainly they are not going to switch the programs because they are way too excited for the following one. And while the kids are waiting for the next cartoon, advertisements will show up. Which is actually not a bad thing because they are sometimes quite entertaining in my opinion. But of course all those ads give the young people a desire to get those products next time when they are going grocery shopping with their parents. Depending on the child's personality it can react dramatically if the parents refuse to get them a toy they have seen on the TV. But there are also parents who want to make their kid as happy as possible and keep getting them whatever they want which will make the young children spoiled without them realizing at that young age from two to five. Although at the end it depends on how parents are taking actions towards different types of ads and how they are going to deal with the desire which their child got from television advertising. Now that I mentioned different types of ads I want to say a few things about it.
Myself I've never experienced any bad influence from a TV advertisement and I believe that people make sure that most children program are safe to watch. However there are also very inspirational ads I've seen in my life such as an insurance advertisement which can be very touching. I remember crying because of an advertisement from an Asian insurance company. If people will support the company is our decision. But at the end I still learnt something out of that advertisement. What I am trying to say is, with ads you can basically talk to people all over the world over the TV screen or any other types of screens. That's why I don't think it should be forbidden for kids to watch television advertisements. 
To sum up, television advertising can influence people's mind easily but how we are going to act after watching it is our decision and the parent's responsibility. ",14
144,"First of all, opponents of television advertising argue that children this young are influenced very easily by their surroundings. Amongst other things, this can be their parents, friends they play with and also television. If they are being exposed to television advertising, critics say, their personalities can't develop as well as if they weren't, because advertisements are always very persuasive and try to change people's opinions, which is not something a young person should experience. 
Second, some people say that young kids should spend their time on more useful things like playing with their friends or crafting instead of sitting still all day in front of the TV. By allowing advertising directed towards children, companies are more likely to try to persuade parents to let their daughters and sons watch television more often, since they can possibly make profit out of it. This is a trend that is not beneficial for the children's brain development, since passive activities like watching TV don't create a lot of connections inside of the brain. ",14
145,"Television advertising is a controversial topic, especially if it is targeting young children. As usual,there is not only one right opinion.
Parents must be aware of the ""risks"" if they let their children watch television. They should be aware of the consequences of this useful ""game"" if they just want to get their children doing something. Advertising targeting young children might have some positiv aspects. Since young children are very susceptable for new information (including advertising), the believe everything said in an advertisement. If we take a milk promotion as an example(considering milk is healthy): The advertisement is telling that every child needs milk in order to grow up and become strong. Probably, most of the children disliking milk before the ad, will start to drink milk, since they believe they need it. 
On the other hand,advertisement on television specified for young children is very dangerous. Children are probably the most likely to get manipulated since they have not learned yet how to evaluate information they receive. So if there is an ad for a chocolate bar saying that it is very tasty,good for children and even can replace a whole meal, young children are likely to believe in this. Furthermore, advertising directed toward young children teachs them materialistic values already in their young age. 
In conclusion, the negative aspects overweigh the positive ones. Even though parents have a certain responsibility for their children, it is unreasonable to place specific advertising for children of that young age. It is not necessary to make our children already ""adicted"" when they are 4 or 5, not to television and not to other promoted goods including lots of sugar etc. Therefore, we need to be careful what we promot.",14
146,"Television advertising is pretty controversal, especially for young children.
While watching TV, the majority of young children is influenced by the music they hear or the colours they see. 
They often like colourful and noisy things which make them laugh or dance or sing. Most of the television advertising is just like that today and I think that these children are really into this kind of advertising. When they see a cool toy advertising with a nice song you keep in your mind they admire to have it and start to annoy their family because they want it as a gift for christmas or their birthday. Otherwise television advertising is good to help the kids making decisions about their wishes for christmas, eastern, etc. There are TV channels only for young children which don't show any advertising and I think that this is very good. There are only the TV shows and no advertising for adults which could be bad for the education of them. Many terrible things happen daily and young children should not get the brutal impressions of terror and pain because that could be bad for their view on people in their later lives. You can also make advertising for useless or bad things and use nice characters or colours for it. As long as it makes them happy, the young children don't care aboout the content of it. For example there is much advertising for sweets which re not good for young children's but they want to eat them because of the interesting TV spot.
That's the reason why I agree with the statement that television advertising for young children should not be allowed. They start wanting to have the newest stuff and they only get influenced by colours and sounds because they aren't able to think about the content yet. ",14
147,"At first I will give you some reasons for television advertising directed toward young children. With television advertising children learn the new things in the world. They see what it gives for new plays and they can make some specific wishes for birthday or christmas. The parents can use this wishes as a little present if the children were nice and help in the household. 
But they are also some reasons against television advertising. Children had a bad environement and to many wishes. They will have everything new and it is very hard to say ""No!"" to lovely big eyes from your kid. Children need to play in the natur with some things from the natur. It is important that children learn to play alone without the new plays. ",14
148,"one more point is the children can be addicted to the tv, they might sit there only to see the newest products. The ad`s are presenting fun and colors and a happy world and changes the way of thinking of a child.",14
149,"On the other hand this advertisings can have a big inluence on the children. Young kids aged two to five can hardly denie the feeling of wanting something. If they see an attractive toy, they want to have it and they will tell heir parents to buy it. Of course then it's the parents job if they'll buy the toy ore not, but the kids will learn this procedure of seeing a toy on TV and telling their parents to buy it, so they will sort of learn that they can have something just by watching TV and not buy for example accomplishing something.",14
150,"There are TV channels which are in particular for children and surely they also have advertising. In the following I will discuss, if television advertising directed toward young children should be forbidden.
First of all one can say that there are already some channels which have no advertising anymore, for example the KIKA channel in Germany. 
Now I will come to my first pro argument which is that the firms want to make money though. They have to show their toys or stuff like that to the children, otherwise maybe nobody will buy it, beacuse parents do not watch children TV shows. 
Secondly advertising causes no real harm, the children wont get a psychological disease, if they see advertising once in a while.
In opposition to that I want to mention some arguments against the advertising. 
Firstly advertising is boring, especially for children, which is not alawys bad, because maybe consequently they switch the TV off and go playing outside.
Furthermore advertising influences the children in a certain direction, much more than adults or adolescents. The reason for that is that children have no idea that advertising is made up by firms with actors, so that it is a ""lie"". They only see happy children playing with a new toy and out of this reason they want to have it, too. Most times theses things are unnessesary and quite expensive, so the parents do not want to buy it. This will make both parties sad, the children as well as the parents. 
If it is the case that the child gets what it wants, it wont have fun with it forever,the child will see a new advertising and desires a new item. This could becomne a kind of circle.
To conclude I would say that even though advertisings for young children cause no real harm, it should be not allowed, because it bores the children and it causes an unhappy family situation. Beyond this I would admit that in my opinion watching TV is not good for children at all, however playing with friends oder outside is a better alternative. Sometimes an ad might be appropriate, but there cannot be so much of it or even hidden advertising in shows, which children are not able to discover.",15
151,"Im my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Because television advertising can be informative for something the children wants, and the parents shouldn't allow everything when his children wants something.
 
Not every television advertising is bad for young children. If there is a advertising about a special toy, why should that be forbitten for children? It is clear that the parents aren't happy when their child wants everything what they see in the television advertising. But they can learn something about it and the parents know what is fancy and what not.
Another point is that the parents should decide what the children are watching in the TV. And if there is something what the children want, the parents shouldn't allow everything. They should say no and must be consequent. ",15
152,"In my opinion television advertising shouldn't be allowed for young children, as they are manipulative and create a world which does not exist. On top of that these young kids get introduced to a society of consumption which is n't good",15
153,"When discussing about whether television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed or not you can choose between two different points of view. There are several arguments that speak for and against it. 
Nowadays, young children are already watching television. Their parents prefer to let them be entertained in front of the television instead of raising them up properly. Obviously, the children are confronted with lots of information but because of them being so young it often doesn't matter what they are watching. They can't distinguish nor memorise the information they receive from the television. On the other hand, allowing children to watch television advertisiments may lead to damage in the long-term as they start requesting the advertised products.
In addition to this, a young child may not even be capable of thinking on its own yet. It may not link the idea of seeing a product on an advertisement and the idea of going to the store to buy it. Also, children aren't even capable of going to the store on their own, so advertising for young children on television may really just be a waste of money. In comparison, one could also say that in the long-term young children may really feel the urge of buying advertised products as they were introduced to advertising very early in their life.
In conclusion, I want to mention that, in my opinion, television advertising directed toward young children should not be prohibited because it probably doesn't affect the children in the long-term. I would even go so far as calling it a waste of money because it won't be the children who buy the products but their parents.",15
154,"In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of several reasons. First of all, children are not a part of the adult community yet and do not earn any money. It is the responsibiltiy of the parent to decide what is good for their child and what they want to buy for it. Therefore the advertising should be focused on parents and not on to children. 
Secondly, children are easily influenced, which makes it a lot easier for advertisment companies to get into the children's heads. That fact brings a certain danger, some people could misuse that opportunity to influence children in a bad way. And it could also be a reason for a quality drop in television advertising.
I also think that children should spend more time in nature playing, making social contacts and making a lot of experiences out there in the world. It might be alright to watch television from time to time, but if the advertisement encourages children to play with some product and make them believe that they actually need it to be happy it makes them addicted to things, which could kill off children's natural eagerness to live and play.
Having too many things or products also dicreases the children's creativity, since they do not have to come up with any own ideas to play anymore. This would lead to serious problem when the children become teenagers or adults. They would always have to rely on products to entertain them.
All in all, television advertising targeting children seems to be a very bad idea to me. It does not focuse on the buyer but on the user of the product, which does not make sense because the parent is responsible for their child and should decide what they play with. It has also a high possiblity of influencing children negatively. Other points are that it discourgages the children to make any experiences in the real world and it decreases a children's natural creativity.",15
155,"Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
Television advertising has a really big impact on children. Mostly the television advertising directed toward children shows a situation where other children play with or use the advertised thing. In the advertising everything seems to be great. Children think, if they have the advertised thing, their life would be like the one shown on TV. But as soon as they got this thing, they realise that it isn't as funny as they had thought, they start to ignore that they had it and they want to have the next thing.
If Children would like to have the advertised thing they had seen in TV, they ask for it all the time and the parents have to say strictly no or if they aren't that strictly, they will buy it. But if they start to buy one thing, they will have to buy a sencend thing and so on. In the end, it's going to be a big amount of money they spent for these things and the children aren't happier with these things. That the parents don't get in such a situation, they can't let their children watch TV, but in todays time, this is really difficult.
In conclusion, the children and the parents don't profit from the advertising and they just waste money for something they don't really like a long time. The best thing to do is not to allow television advertising.",15
156,"The statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed"" is a very controversy but actual theme.
I definitely think it should not be allowed to show little children advertisements. Firstly because they see it often enough in public or here it on the radio. Secondly because advertisement on television is so much more deep and figurative because of the possibility of filming, picture mmaterial, special affects connected with sound, lightning, colouring and camera movings. 
These huge ammount of information and pictures in such a short time is too much for little children's brains and could lead to headache or other physical and even psychical problems. 
Another thing is how you could seperate advertisement for grown ups and for children. Nobody knows which television programms children watch and nobody knows during wich time of the day. So it would be dramatic if a little child sees advertising for or against war, beer or cigarrets. Like I said earlier children going to see these things soon enough so they should not be confronted with this in an even more accurate way on television as well.
Advertising often leads to depressions or self-harming, anxiety or eating disorders for many boys and girls (aged ten to more or less open end)according to several studies. People start to compare themself or their life with others. Actually they compare with advertisement whichdefinitely does not show real life and is always faked in many points. But advertising seems to be real especially on television so people dont see how unusual and unnatural it is. 
This is a never ending circle because people will always find new things to compare with, new trends are going to show up, advertising will change and companies produce new ones fitting to the newest trends.
Bacuse of that it is important to safe children from these wrong pictures and impressions about how life is which they get from advertising. It is more important to show and teach them the real things that matter in life or even little aspects for example what a strawberry is and how it real and natural taste is. The children of today are getting so fast old and behave or have to behave like teenagers or grown ups that it is very important to let them be little children as long as they can. ",15
157,"Many people have different oppinions on whether television advertising directed toward young children who are aged two to five should or should not be allowed.
Nowadays there are many children who watch television even the really young one's who aren't even old enough to understand everything that is happening. 
That is why they probably don't really understand the television advertising which is why it isn't dangerous when it's directed toward them. The young children can only understand everything through their vision.
When parents see the advertising which often is about some kind of toy that every children wants to have they could take that as an idea for a birthday present or something like that which would be an advantage of the advertising.
But there are often children who act in this kind of advertising who are just as young as the children that are watching these advertisings which is a thing that in my oppinion should be talked about as well. Children who aren't old enough to decide whether they want to act or not could be used by their parents for money which would be considered as child work. The problem is that if this had to be forbidden it should be forbidden for every kind of television which means that they also could'nt act in movies or television shows and then again the movies would become rather boring. 
All in all there is no reason for me why television advertising should not be allowed apart from the fact that the children who act in the advertisings are too young to make that decision themselve because often enough the young children don't even understand what is happening in there.",15
158,"I agree with the statement that Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed. At this age children are easy to influence. They donÂ´t have the ability to decide wether something is right or wrong.
By influencing the children, the parents get influenced as well, because the children talk their parents into buying things. By directing television advertising toward young children, the kids get connected to the advertinsing and market world by this young age and are not able to develop their own mind and own opinion. They have an opinion on whats right or wrong and whatÂ´s good to buy planted in their minds.",15
159,"Watching Television is quite normal in our modern world. Almost everybody does it and many love it. But many people hate advertisements. They destroy the whole scenerie of a good film we are watching an most likely show things we really do not need. But especially young kids watch TV these days and they get overrun with advertisements concipated just for them.
The statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children (aged two to five) should not be allowed."" is a really controverse topic which is often discussed. 
This is a very difficult question if this should be allowed or ist should not and I think there are many arguments that support this these but also some against it. In the following text I will discuss at least a few of them. 
One argument that is against the statement is that many companies would not sell any products for children they produce if they would not advertise it in the TV. Children in this age do not go into a shopping mall and buy their stuff at it. They tell her parents what they want to have and most likely they see it on the TV, the advertisements are one of the few ways for companies to sell their products. 
An argument that supports the these is that really young children are easy to manipulate and that might happen if they watch advertisements on the TV. They do not have an own opinion and they witch it really fast an support everything that is shown to them. Especially ads that directly go towards the children is really dangerous in this case. They can get manipulated so they could support things which are bad for themselves for example.
Another good example for the advertisements is that they could do the complete opposite of the argument I just mentioned. They could inform the children or teach them some things they need for the future. The advertising would be used for a good cause so to say.
TV advertising could cause many troubles if it is abused and it could ""force"" the young children to sit in front of the TV the whole day. They would not do anything else. Another point is that some kids would be angry if they do not get the things they wanted to get. This could be horrible for the parents who have to deal with the children after this.
In my opinion the advertisements in TV should stop. Especially for young children. This power is abused too often for example with manipulating the children. They get a totally wrong ""picture"" of the world and the other people and might be forced to sit in front of the TV the whole day just because of the advertisements they watched and still watch. The arguments that count for advertisements in TV are far too small. They could never get bigger than the arguments that support the statement.",15
160,"Televisions are something very common in our modern society. Nearly in every house is one or are more than one televisions. Everybody loves to watch TV because you do not have to think for yourself. A lot of businesses use it to make adverts. The question is: Should this be forbidden for young children? 
There are two positions to take. One is to allow this because as a mother you can put your children in front of the TV and they are happy. You can do something on your own. Maybe they even learn something. Especially series only for children can be useful. 
On the other hand there are more arguments that it should not be allowed. To much TV on each day can damage a brain very bad. The children do not have to think on their owns. The get a wrong image of the world. Even their fantasy can be blocked because they do not think and they never have to invent something during playing in the garden. Many relationships can not be developed because they do not interact with other children. At worst case not even with their parents. The can not get some faith or believe in their family. How should it work that they can become a good person. They will have many problems in school. Even during adulthood. 
Another negative point of advertisement is that they give a wrong image of the world. With advertisement you manipulate the people. They want to be like the pretty people in the clips, they want to buy the products and even they want to be like this people. Especially for children it can cause diseases. For example anorexia and others like this. They are not very selfconfident. 
My opinion about this topic is very clear. I think young children should not watch TV. The better are movie on DVD or Blue-Ray. Because there is nothing else than the movie. I think a good solution are plays or playing with other children in the neighbourhood. Probably a Babysitter can help to do something on your own for half a day. Relationships are very important. Without a family or frineds you can trust in you are nothing in your life.  ",16
161,"Nowadays, young childrens are watching more Tv than childrens who were born ten or more years before. The fascinating technologie is really interesting for young childerns about this age. In this age the chilrderns are learning a lot and they take everything what they hear and see and with that informations they learn and grow up. So it is really important that they learn from real sources like the parents, not from the TV. There are a lot of advertising in the TV, that tell nothing important or sometimes they show up a wrong reality. The parents can't conrol what the childrens are watching and thats a big problem. It isn't good for them to just consum TV. It is better if they go outside and play games, so they can explore for them self the real world. I think in nowadays time it is important that you don't just sit in your room and watch TV. You have to get outside and see the real world. It is more common to just watch TV the hole intheier day. Exspecially for young childresn aged two to five. I understand if they are fascinated of the TV, but as parents you heve to defend your childrens from bad influence. And there are a lot of bad TV advertising. So I am fully against Television advertising toward young childrens, because there are bad influences in the TV, whitch can understand wrongly. And in this age they learn everything, what they been told, so they take it how it is and i think they can't decide if this in the TV is reality.",16
162,"Children, aged two to five, shouldn't watch TV so often, because they are in the most important Age of their life. At this age, they are learning to speak, to walk, maybe to read and so on. Television advertising could cancel these exercises. The television advertising could support the children to watch TV all day long and they want something from the Television advertising, toys or somthing else, like smartphones. But Television advertising is also helpful. The children can find some thimgs, which are useful for speaking, walking etc. If the parents are poor, it could also be, that the children can' get everything they wan't. This could be helpful for the education of the children, because they can concentrate more on things they have to learn. It is like in school, if children have things they like more, then studying or doing homework, they will do them mostly before homework, etc. In my opinion, children should be allowed to watch TV and see the Television advertising, but not so often. They should go outside and learn something from the nature and have fun. It doesn't need electronical devices every time, to be happy. But to be honest, the most children nowadays dont even now the Nature, because the're sitting all day long in their rooms and play video games.",16
163,"I agree with this statement. But today`s young children are even without the television confrontated with advertising and other things which children some years ago haven`t ever seen. Maybe in some years it will be normal that a five year old boy is using a handy and can explain his father how to use his computer. When I`m travelling i can often see how the parents give their children electronic devices like an Ipad. Like this the children are occupied and the parents don`t have to look after their kid. The children are already used to see advertising everywhere so I don`t think that with a televsion advertising they would have some damage. When the children are watching tv and an advertisement appears where for example the newest thing to play is introduced the children want it. Like this the parents get more and more in an obligation to buy their kid everything. My personal problem is that the children nowadays play with their phone and not with their friends anymore. All the social interactions while playing a game with other kids aren`t there anymore. I think later they willl have problems to get in contact with other people because it`s the time of 3-7 years where children have no problems to play with any child. I cant`figure out any advantage if the television advertising is directed toward young children. It`s normal that every company wants his own advertisement in the tv beacause it`s a good maybe the best platform to find new people buying their product. And it`s the right of every company to show an advertisement but if it`s for children up to five it`s not okay.
",16
164,"The television advertising can be a good entertainment for the little. If  the parents are occupied with their house work,the television can be an easy solution to make the children sitting calmly in their chair and not distracting the work of the parents
The little children have also a possibility to learn something from the television. There are a lot of children programmes which have the aim to teach the children. 
But there are also risks which one should not exclude. The programmes on the children channels are not always that informative and helpful. There are a lot of entertainment which does not make any sense. $
The television can have a bad impact on the health of the children, their eye-sight can get worse by watching a lot of television. 
In my opinion the children group aged two to five should not be allowed to watch television daily. The television advertising is not necessairy for such a young group. The children should rather be playing with their cars or barbies than watching television programmes. There are better solutions to entertain the young children. ",16
165,"Television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. 
To start with an important point, why television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed is,
that alot of young children can learn by watching TV, sure they have to watch a programm which is good for their age.
If they watch programms in diffrent languages they can learn some words and important sentences.
An other case is, that their parents have more time for themselfes so they are less stressed and they have not to pay money for an expensive babysitter.
It is also important to confront childrens early with electronic devises, like the TV, because actually you should have the know-how for these things, how they work, how to find the right programm, how to change language and so on. If every child is allowed to watch TV, just partly of the day, maeby an hour or an half, the children could have more the same chances later at kindergarden and at school. 
But there are also some things which are contra watching TV in these ages. 
A child which is just two to five years old should also play with other childrens outside. When children pass a lot of time by watching TV they have no time to play outside. An other bad case is that there is a lot of unimportant, bad things in TV and children could be anxious after watching TV. The parents also should not forget to do something with their child because it is important for a child.
In my opinion Televison advertising directed toward young children should be allowed but just partly.",16
166,"The statement ""Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed"" is a thing which is often discussed in the media today. More and more parents allow their children to watch Tv every day in the morning and also in the evening, often the whole day but the question which we should think about is if that is good for the health and the brain quality of our children?
Children which are looking Tv every day have a more bad concentration than kids which are not looking Tv the whole day because the ""Tv-kids"" donÂ´t know how to give tasks to themself and how to not going to be boring when they are alone in for example their room. Children which are not looking Tv the whole day or not so often know how to play with themself and they have a better concentration because they can play with things longer without beeing boring after a time.
A second important point to say is that the kids which are looking Tv every day have a bad fantasy because their own fantasy is not very supported by looking Tv then in Tv everything is how the executer wrote it and the children donÂ´t have the chance to change something in the history or to create new characters. So their creativity has a limit but children which are not looking Tv the whole day have a much better creativity because when they play they can imagine everything and there is no limit like in the Tv. 
The most important argument is that parents which decided to make children shoud take care of them and for me itÂ´s not to make the Tv to the animateur of the children. When you decided to have kids you have to take always care of them for the rest of your life and try to make them happy in every situation of their life.
At the end I can say that children are a big responsibility and that it should be clear that you canÂ´t give them away when theyÂ´re getting on your nerves or if something donÂ´t happens like you want it to happen so I think Tv advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because there are so many things you can do with them and which are making your childen more happy than just sitting towards the Tv and looking on it.",16
167,"Television advertising directed towards young children could have some advantages but also disadvantages. At the age from two to five, children have to learn new things and start being prepared for their following life, like school. On the one hand television can help to lern new words or something about life. On the other hand the childrem can also learn these things from the real world. In this period of their lifes they experience a lot of things in the nature, with their partents or children who are their age. Go to different places and see new things in the world can help to grow up in a better way. If the weather for example isn't good and the children haven't got the chance to go outside and make experiences there, they can also do something else than watch the television. Their parents can read out books for them, the children can play with different types of things like little cars or dolls. To play with the parents, other family members or kids their age is important for the future. Children will learn to interact with other people, share things with them and how good it feels to have people around you and not being alone. In my opinion television advertising directed toward yound children should be allowed, because in general it isn't completely bad for them. But i think parents should create better days for their children and do things like i talked about before. If they sometimes let their children watch the television, thats totally okay, but it should not be the whole day. Sometimes the parents have to focus on other things like clean the house or do something for work, in my opinion it's okay if the children watch tv. Of course it's better if they will play with some real things but sometimes they don't even want than. To conclude i would say that the Television for young children isn't the best, but it isn't the worst either. ",16
168,"Would you want the bad influence of television advertising directed toward your child? I suppose not. And there are some good reasons why not:
They need toys at teir stage of development. Young children need to play with things they can touch, and toys which are invented for the stage they are at. Televisions are far too fast, altough there are series for children on TV, which is a benefit, they learn quick to change the channel, and the risk is too big, that the parents don`t pay enough attention, because they need time for their own and their child watches something else.
The development of young children is influenced badly. Their brains are not developed enough to be able to make a whole out of the things they hear, and the movement of the lips they see. That`s an ability they learn with time, but because the diffrent signals they receive are not received at the same time, they may develop speaching problems.
They learn at an early age, that electronic devices belong in the daily life. This increases the risk of addiction in their life when they are older, and altough it isn`t proved yet that elecronic devices have a bad influence on our health, there are incidents to this theory, and especially for  the young children we should be careful until it is proved, that the theory is wrong.
Children are the weakest part of our society while, at the same time, the most important one, because they will create the future, but at an early age, that`s why they need our protection. To provide abusing the TV as a toy, which it is not, to help them developing quikly and in a natural way, to avoid later problems like speaching faults or addiction, we should not allow television advertising directed toward young children.",16
169,"Nowadays the world is full of modern techniques, smartphones or computers which make everything easier the people think. So itÂ´s nothing special when you see a small boy playing on his smartphone the whole day anyway heÂ´s not even in high school. I donÂ´t think that this is something normal because itÂ´s much to early for using smartphones in such a young age.
So in my opinion Televison advertising directed toward young children shold not be allowed. 
Of course the young kids grow up with this modern communication, smartphones and televison like the generation before grew up with something else which was typical in their time. Another poinjt is that they will get used of all these computers and smartphones anyway only a few years later.  
Despite I think that the age of two to five is much too early to watch TV. ItÂ´s really bad for their concentration. This is something adult people realize twhen they use their smartphone for example. The time runs and you donÂ´t really realize that while chatting or srcolling through facebook. The concentration suffers a lot with all the social media. 
Especially young children are still developing also in their head and watching several TV series with funny characters isntÂ´t really helpful in this time. 
Of course some stuff in TV they can learn something from wonÂ´t be that bad and maybe they understand it a little bit better because of pictures, noises or special characters. The problem is that children from two to five arenÂ´t even able to read in this age so they start watching TV before they are able to read a book.
I think that children should be able to read before they start watching TV so that the television doesnÂ´t even need to produce a programm for young children from two to five.

171,"Television advertising is seen by everyone daily. Companies are advertising their products and special offers. Adults know how to deal with advertising but we were asking ourselves the question if television advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. 
Advertising made for young kids is usually about toys or cartoons. It's made colorful with lots of big impressing pictures which is why kids think it's interesting to watch. If there is an advertising about a brand new toy the children always want to have it so they go to their parents and ask them to buy it. The kids are too young to understand that people always want to sell their products and kids are the best way to do this because parents usually can't say no to their young kids. They also don't understand that all of these toys cost a lot of money. Nevertheless children at the age of two to five don't understand most of what's said in advertisings which is why I think that it doesn't really matter if companies use advertisings or not especially because they won't be able to remember it the very next day. 
In my opinion television advertising for young children are very tricky because kids with their positive minds believe everything and they get impressed easily. So I think a few advertisings can be allowed if they are made carefully. But there shouldn't be as much ads as for adults so the kids can focus on their cartoon without beeing interrupted by multiple advertising. Also parents should try to explain to their kid that they can't have everything that's advertised, I think it's important for kids to know that.",17
172,"All in all, television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed in my opinion. That is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children.+",17
173,"In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because of several reasons. First of all, children are not a part of the adult community yet and do not earn any money. It is the responsibiltiy of the parent to decide what is good for their child and what they want to buy for it. Therefore the advertising should be focused on parents and not on to children. 
Secondly, children are easily influenced, which makes it a lot easier for advertisment companies to get into the children's heads. That fact brings a certain danger, some people could misuse that opportunity to influence children in a bad way. And it could also be a reason for a quality drop in television advertising.
I also think that children should spend more time in nature playing, making social contacts and making a lot of experiences out there in the world. It might be alright to watch television from time to time, but if the advertisement encourages children to play with some product and make them believe that they actually need it to be happy it makes them addicted to things, which could kill off children's natural eagerness to live and play.
Having too many things or products also dicreases the children's creativity, since they do not have to come up with any own ideas to play anymore. This would lead to serious problem when the children become teenagers or adults. They would always have to rely on products to entertain them.
All in all, television advertising targeting children seems to be a very bad idea to me. It does not focuse on the buyer but on the user of the product, which does not make sense because the parent is responsible for their child and should decide what they play with. It has also a high possiblity of influencing children negatively. Other points are that it discourgages the children to make any experiences in the real world and it decreases a children's natural creativity.",17
174,All in all the topic if television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed is difficult to anwer but on my opinion i think these kinds of advertising shouldn't be allowed. The main reason is the on my oppinion too high impact on the little children which could lead to social problems. ,17
175,"Many people have different oppinions on whether television advertising directed toward young children who are aged two to five should or should not be allowed.
Nowadays there are many children who watch television even the really young one's who aren't even old enough to understand everything that is happening. 
That is why they probably don't really understand the television advertising which is why it isn't dangerous when it's directed toward them. The young children can only understand everything through their vision.
When parents see the advertising which often is about some kind of toy that every children wants to have they could take that as an idea for a birthday present or something like that which would be an advantage of the advertising.
But there are often children who act in this kind of advertising who are just as young as the children that are watching these advertisings which is a thing that in my oppinion should be talked about as well. Children who aren't old enough to decide whether they want to act or not could be used by their parents for money which would be considered as child work. The problem is that if this had to be forbidden it should be forbidden for every kind of television which means that they also could'nt act in movies or television shows and then again the movies would become rather boring. 
All in all there is no reason for me why television advertising should not be allowed apart from the fact that the children who act in the advertisings are too young to make that decision themselve because often enough the young children don't even understand what is happening in there.",17
176,"In my opinion television advertising toward young children should not be allowed, because the hard fact is that they just should not watch television at this Age. The producers want to manipulate the brains of this young children with this adverts but i think its a money waste and a thing which makes no sense to me. Generally they won't understand anything or they just recognize the pictures and after that they consider to buy that what they saw, because they dont understand if it's good or bad to them.",17
177,"In conclusion I would say that television advertising towards young children should not be allowed. It is just a easy way to manipulate parents to buy something for their children by using the children, which cannot decide how usefull the product is.",17
178,"Television advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed.
In today's world advertising is an important role. We advertise almost for everything such as a specific product, a shop, television, brandd and so on, but should there really be advertising directed toward young children. Some parents find it dangerous or not good for their children, other may think it's good for the children. ",17
179,"In my opinion television advertising directed toward young children should be allowed. Because I think that the parents are responsible for their children, they should keep their children under controll, that they do not watch to much television. ",17
180,"In my opinion advertising directed toward young children shouldn't be allowed. The influence that it takes, is just to big. Children have other options to get to know the world and see what's out there. ",18
181,So in the end I think that advertisement aimed at young children should be allowed. It won't ruin the child's live and it's the parents' duty to make sure the child is prepared to face advertisement in the future. ,18
182,"In my opinion, advertising toward young children should not be allowed since the advertisers use the childish naivety and simplicity to influence kids to their profit and since it can cause an addiction to toys or new things without the kids being happy with what they have.",18
183,"I personally think, that advertising directed toward young children should still be allowed because it is a kind of force to disallow these advertisings. Further on I donÂ´t know childrens who are seriously influenced by these advertisings and who were damaged by them. ",18
184,"Because of all these arguments listed above, I come to the conclusion that advertising directed towards young children should not be allowed. They do not have the ability to decide in terms of buying and get influenced very easily. 
 ",18
185,"
In my opinion advertising directed toward young children should not be allowed because children are way to easy to manipulate in their age. But on the other hand I think that it is very important that parents teach their children how advertising works and how it affects the peoples minds. Furthermore companies know that children are easy to manipulate and so they are more interested in convincing children to buy their product than honestly explaining their product and it strenghts.",18
186,"In my opinion, it should not be allowed to direct advertising to young children. It is causes unnecessary problems. Kids should not be influenced by advertising. Otherwise they start to measure themself with other people and with what they have and what they don't have. ",18
187,In conclusion I think that unless you are a person who does not care about children you shouldn't allow advertising directed to young children.,18
188,All in all I would say that advertising directed a t young children should be banned. It creates a false image and influences them to much.,18
189,"I personally donÂ´t think that advertisement directet towards young children should not be allowed because in the end the parents have to decide on what to buy. In addition there are multiple advertisements directet to any group of people, with the direct goal to manipulate them, and make them buy different things. They are allowed too. ",18
