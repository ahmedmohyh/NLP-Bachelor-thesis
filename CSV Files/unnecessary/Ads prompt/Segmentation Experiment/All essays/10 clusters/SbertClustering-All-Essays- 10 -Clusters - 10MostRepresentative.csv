16, about advertisment to yound kids a lot of kids havent got ,1
17, that there are huge enterprises that have only one goal and this is to sell more of this product because they want to earn money in this age children are ,1
18, that it wouldnt be that way if they get what the add want them to buy many years ago for exemple there was an advertising for a toy for girls ans it was connectet with arielle in the add you could see two girls who were swimming in a sea and they have seen many colourful fish when i was younger i thougt i would ,1
19, that advertising  is a good invention for the concerns but not for the moneybag of the parents and the eduacation of the children ,1
20, the child see something that it want and theen thee parents dont buy it it will be unhappy ,2
21, is that the children if they get most of the toys or something like this which is presented in the advertising they will play with this and forgot to go outside meeting friends or do hobbies and this age is really important for the livingprocess in this age children should learn to communicate with other children and learn to work or play as a team all of that is very important â´for surviving in the modern society so ,2
22," they parents read  a book for his child the donâ´t have contact with televisions and other electric things in this age the donâ´t need in this young age contact with the media of the world it is not importen to do taht in thei age thy wont to have a nice childhood with much time outside and not in the livingroom also the children dont understand what is wright or wrong what the people do in the televison and they do the wrong thinks because the learn it from a show charakter  
but ther are many television shows for young children who thy can learn things for the kindergarden or the school ",2
23,children aged  have to learn very much about live for example about their needs and how they had to react in diffrent situations one of this situation is the television advertising they had to diside whether they resist this advertising or not if not they had to ask their parents whether they could buy them this things and than it is by the parents if their child gets this thing for example the child watches tv his favourit series dragons or somthing and ,2
24," that they could grow up much better and much faster the reason which totally agerees to this is the television program for young kids if it wouldnâ´t makle sense to let kids aged  watch the tv there wouldnâ´t be this television program

on the other ",2
25," they might get shown creative activities modern toys and because of that they can get impressions of how to be creative furthermore they are learning to become carefully and learn about the possible risks if they are discussing this with their parents
the problem which could come up is that children at this age are believing many things they hear and see and dont know about these risks what would become a problem if they dont talk about it with their parents eg 
today its easy to get acces to the intenet and their were already problems internationally known of children buying things or games on the intenet not knowing they cost money

in my opinion it shouldnt be allowed influencing children on porpuse with advertisment beacause of the reason i talked about above and the ",2
26," the children could get influenced in a bad way by advertisng they see in the television

secondly its essential to see that ones childhood plays an important role in the construction of a lifea basis the way you grow up and the particular influences like ",2
27," children learn more in the real world and it is important for children to play a lot an have friends with whom they can have adventures also watching television in asbolutely not necessairy especially not for children aged  they have to learn that the life is not about tv stars and shows but more about friends and living its own life if they are to often confronted with such things they can get aggressive and unsociable 
so my own children will have a fix short time ",2
28, years children learn a lot about themselves and about others they see how this world works and adapt to the casualities in it it can be good to show them the reality ,2
29, that it is important to mention that the children are very young and could get influenced by the television advertising for example ,2
30, for the success of  companies or for someone who offers something on each corner we colud find an advertisment about a product or service the advertisment on television has much influence on the people who watch a film series or an other show there are advertisments about every things and for each age of a person the television  advertising  should be allowed often the young children couldnt buy the thing in the advertisment on his own they dont have enought money or they are ,3
31,in todays society advertising is a big part of television these advertisment target different types of people and interests and as it comes some ,3
32," people who works by the television wouldnt send advertisement because they cant control which guy are watching tv
an other problem is young children cant understand what a meaning by an advertisement excactly is if they wanted to buy something because they saw this in the tv the parents could decided to buy it or not children cant buy something allone and normally they dont have the money for this
but one problem has advertising advertisement about leisure activities like diving or swimming in a river or something other dangerous is for a young child a new experience to do this children want always to learn new things im afraid that many accidents like this in the world has passed
in the end i can say im ",3
33,"advertisments take a long time span in the modern tv often the adverts are personalised for the watchers for example on the childentelevisionprogram there are shown adverts for games and toys but hasnt got this a bad influence espacially on the little children who are easy to manipulate

39, that the young children want to have the products which are present in the television advertising furthermore this shows that the producer of the television advertising just want to sell their products and ,3
40," they shouldnt watch tv 

if we say a child cant watch tv it plays with other untechnolized products which arent as dangerous as technology to find out some things a children shouldnt or to see something which can dramalize a young child but television canals mostly have some shows which are made for them and are helpfull to learn about our earth our world and the life which is waiting for the young guys

when children look news at the televion or documentions it can be good for the children because they know ",4
46,nowadays observing young children watching television is nothing astonishing anymore there are a lot of kids who are not older than five years old spending several hours a day and doing noting but staring into television ,4
47, children should generally not watch television in this adge because you cant allways controll what they see and ,4

television advertising is actually a very smart thing they are made in a very smart way to make you buy things even tought you probably do not need them especially young children are very naive one can manipulate them very easily young children do not know anything about smart shopping about what to buy and what to not buy when a child sees a toy in a televisions advertising it does not think twice the child does not make any toughts about the use or the quality of the toy a young child probably does not even understand words like quality and use television advertising has no other use than making people buy things it does not show one anything usefull television advertising is using young childrens naivity the people who make these television advertisings know ecsactly that young children would want to buy anything they see on television they know that as soon as a child wants something it is going to annoy their parents till it gets what it wants and the parents kind of do not have another choice than to buy their children what they want so moraly it is not okey to use the naivity of a young child and most improtantly television advertising is a huge way of propaganda and ",5

78, not able to buy it alone so the televison advertising for the young children are more directed to the parents of them and they can decide if they want to buy the thing in the advertisment or not the people dont need this sort of advertising because young people dont watch that much television children  see an advertisment on television about a toy and ,7
