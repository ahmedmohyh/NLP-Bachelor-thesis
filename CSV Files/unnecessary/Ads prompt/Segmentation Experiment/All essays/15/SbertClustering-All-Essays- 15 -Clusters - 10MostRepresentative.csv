0, doesnt make sense to produce such advertisings because children dont or shouldnt spend more time watching television than their parents moreover children cant really react on the advertisings because they dont have money to buy something by themselves ,0
1," the children are to young to understand the meaning of those advertisings this huge industry is not made for  those young candidats

in my oppinion the children at this age shouldnt even watch television tv can be a relly big addiction

2, there is worse stuff in television children could get to see than an advertisement towards them which would be toys and stuff furthermore just by seeing an advertisement it doesnt have to mean that they buy it use it or consume it most of the kids in this age havent even got money ,0

4," to forbit advertising  children on television

first of all it has to be mention that the advertising for children often is very unrealistic because of this the children get a wrong bild of the world and learn things which arent right
but in case of this it must be said that it isnt important which advertising the children see in television they get influenced by each one even if they watch tv and see advertising which is for adults in most cases this is more bad for them than see things which are ",0
5, childrens television is an important source of income for many television companies and it is understandable that the adverts shown are s the audience watching many children enjoy watching the adverts as they can learn about new toys and games on the market another ,0
6, children are easily influenced and get overly excited very quickly so for companies that produce let us say toys it is a good idea to broadcast advertisements on television channels with a young audience ,0
7, television advertising for young children can be dangerous and confusing for them sometimes in television advertisments things are happening which cant possibly happen in real life younger children may not understand that and ,0
8," kids aged  cannot really get what is said to them in television what happens only is that they are like oh i really want that 
children these days are watching tv more than they are playing in the woods making them seeing all these things like toys movies or something which are showed off in the best way possible would make the situation worse they may even spend more time in front of a display
but because of that trend that young kids want to watch more tv marketing functions on television 

my personal opinion is young children may should not be confronted with direct advertising we live in a time where marketing works like that ",0
9," one cant decide quickly and easily how the reaction of young children towards this form of television advertising is
first of all such young children dont really judge about what is good and useful for them and what is bad and not useful for them but according to the normal television advertisings theyll think they have to get these stuff that seems great and good to them but sometimes theyre wrong 
of course it are the parents who decide to buy or dont buy the advertisements but the television advertisings are s the children and not the parents 
another remark is that these children can easily be influenced and some of the advertisements are a way too bad ",0
10, with this statment because young children can be easly influence but ,1
11, its for them and not for the parents or others there are many adventages as disadventages,1
12, that it can be allowed but it is not good for the children and the parents when you have a child in this ages it is funny to go outside and play with your children see how it grows and see how the real world looks like in this ages it is important that they experiment make mistakes and be happy tlevision advertising are allowed but not ,1
13, that think why it shouldnt be allowed are for the sakes of the parents young children can be very greedy ,1
14, that is because the danger of getting influenced is too big and this could be a problem for the whole life of the children,1
15, its a negative influence to the children which should have stopped and if we are able to stop one source of influence than we should to that,1
16, to it this shouldnt affect children in a negative way because thats where the parents have their part to play it is the parents duty to tell a child what it can or should whatch and whats not sensible and ,1
17, be allowed for children what is important ,1
18," for this discussion but stricter regulations can help to ensure the childs mind
at the end i have to say that ",1
19," it shouldnt be allow to do this kids are too vulnerable in this age and television advertising  is unessecary 

",1
20, they see a product in a television advert that they like they do not think about important ,2
21, they see an ad they will buy the product introduced in the ads ,2
22, they see something stupid in the advertising they ,2
23, they see the advertising this is exactly the thing taht the economic want to sell their products and earn profit with them  ,2
24," they see an colorful and interesting advertisement they are leaded to buy this product  

",2
25, for advertising products by manipulating small children they will see things they like on television and are going to tell their parents that they want them ,2
26, the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products but this ,2
27, and the same situation is present in the tvaudience we all know that all around the world there is a huge amount of tvwatchers and to present new products or new devices theres nothing more clever than for a firm to advertise its product on the tv where a lot of people could get interested to it and buy it this is the market world its the way it works with a good advertisement u can convince people to buy the product which is presented lots of children stare at the tvscreen for hours and fill their day watching tv programes and during the breaks advertisements are showed for example some are more directed to women some more for menand ,2
28, that are being presented to them in the advertisements additionally ,2
29, that they want to buy all the products the commercial is showing children ,2
30,television advertising s young children should be forbidden because it influences them in the wrong way they are getting animated to ask their parents for games or clothes they do not need further they are able to manipulate their parents into getting what they want the parents are almost forced to buy the desired things because ,3
31, it should be allowed that children aged  watch advertising in tv but there are reasons for ,3
32,television advertising s young children should not be allowed because they want the things shown in the advertisement they will cry and shout intil they get the things but ,3
33,"television advertising wich is s young children should not be allowed 

television advertising is actually a very smart thing they are made in a very smart way to make you buy things even tought you probably do not need them especially young children are very naive one can manipulate them very easily young children do not know anything about smart shopping about what to buy and what to not buy when a child sees a toy in a televisions advertising it does not think twice the child does not make any toughts about the use or the quality of the toy a young child probably does not even understand words like quality and use television advertising has no other use than making people buy things it does not show one anything usefull television advertising is using young childrens naivity the people who make these television advertisings know ecsactly that young children would want to buy anything they see on television they know that as soon as a child wants something it is going to annoy their parents till it gets what it wants and the parents kind of do not have another choice than to buy their children what they want so moraly it is not okey to use the naivity of a young child and most improtantly television advertising is a huge way of propaganda and ",3
34,"some people have the opinion that television advertising for young children shouldnt be allowed 
maybe they are right young children have to learn about the real world it wont be good for them to take in front of a television and learn with it if this happens children will only know about a virtuell world they wouldnt know much about real things in worst case young children learn only similuar things so in future there wont be personal charakters
young children has to talk with their parents its the exercise by mother and father to learn with the child they have to give them informations about life and important skills like speaking and walking ",3

young children basically grow up with a television in their household nowadays there special tv channels that show a suitable programm for young chidren ",3
36, television advertising toward young children should not be allowed because young children are too easiely influenced they get the wrong idea of happyness and beauty and can not accept themself ,3

but actually advertisment that is driectly directed to the children can somehow influence them in their future consumer behaviour the advertisemnt and the way the parents treat their childrens wishes could optimise or make their former consumer behaviour even worse if a kid gets everything it wants it will possibly buy everything it wants as an adult too and gets selfish additional to that there is some kind of social pressure the parents of the children who are directly confronted with the wishes of their children probably can not afford the toys the comparism kids do about toys puts a thirtend social pressure on the parents and could ",10

beside that  children are very manipulative and get excited easily they cant decide wheter they need the product or not because theyre blinded by the advertisment and its promises if some childrens parents can afford the products and some cant there is going to be rivalry and jealousy because of the promises of the advertising that this product is the best and if you have it youre better ",10

first of all advertisment is a way to earn money by making people buy the things which are showed in this advertisment a big amount of companies use this tool what results in a big competition because of this competition each company tries to specializes themselves for one type of costumer taking that to consideration it is only logical that some are targeting young kids to prevent having a big competition what maximises their income 
however making advertisment meant for young children brings a probelm with it these children are victims of the tactics of several companies they know that children are an easy and vulnerable target because they are not advanced in their evolvement ",13
