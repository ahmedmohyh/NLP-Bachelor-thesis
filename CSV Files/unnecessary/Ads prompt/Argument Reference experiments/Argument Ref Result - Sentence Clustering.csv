0,first of all i would say that it would be difficult to stop televison advertising which is  in the ages ,0,R,0 -> Ads should be stopped or general opinon about the topic,,,,,,80,33
5,my opinion to this topic is that televsion  advertising directed  should be stopped,0,R,,,,,,,,
8,nowadays advertisments are everywhere and anyone watches tv,0,R,,,,,,,,
10,so it may occure the question whether tv advertising  aged  shoud or should not be allowed,0,R,,,,,,,,
29,in the following text i will inform you about television advertising,0,R,,,,,,,,
30,i am agree with this statement because the televison advertising have many negatives effects,0,R,,,,,,,,
43,television advertising  should not be allowed,0,R,,,,,,,,
49,in the following text i will discuss the controverse theme if television advertising  should be allowed or not,0,R,,,,,,,,
54,itâ´s also important for the television advertising to do that,0,F,,,,,,,,
75,in the following essay i will show negativ reasons and examples for the statement  television advertising  should not be allowed,0,R,,,,,,,,
96,in the following text i will write about the aspects which speak for or against the advertisment which is directed ,0,R,,,,,,,,
3,if they always want more toys the parents maybe will follow their wishes to make their children happy and make these wishes come true which can lead to the missing abilities mentioned before,1,R,1 -> children always need the product they see on the tv.,,,,,,,
4,they also wouldnâ´t know the value of these things,1,R,,,,,,,,
11,first you should allow this kind of avertising because it helps the parents to buy things which fit with the specific wishes of their children,1,F,,,,,,,,
14,then the parents can simply buy the object,1,R,,,,,,,,
34,the parents dont like to see their children cry and they bought the object for them,1,R,,,,,,,,
35,forthermore the childrens often dont need the object,1,R,,,,,,,,
87,for example children do not need their own playstation when they are really young they do not know that it is unhealthy if they use it too much for example that they get problems with their eyes et cetera,1,R,,,,,,,,
90,for example if a child sees a plastic horse on tv running around and jumping it would think that this horse is really able to do that but it is not,1,F,,,,,,,,
91,furthermore there would be some children who want to get everything they see on tv and for poor parents it would be really difficult to explain why their friends already own these things which seem to be important,1,R,,,,,,,,
95,in the modern world many children grow up with a lot of technical devices,1,F,,,,,,,,
7,watching tv in these ages can also be discussed whether itâ´s good for them,2,R,2 -> Ads might be important for kids,,,,,,,
31,the first one is that the children often want the object in the televion,2,F,,,,,,,,
55,all in all i think the statement is correct even though it might be important for the television to direct advertising toward those young children,2,F,,,,,,,,
56,young children should play outside more often that is sentence every child has heard a lot of times in her or his young years but why should they play outside,2,F,,,,,,,,
64,actually that is a thing that every child is going to do in that young age they are going to the kindergarden or to a kita and will only be watching tv in the mo0ments when they are at home,2,F,,,,,,,,
65,as you can see there are a lot of times where they do not have time watch tv so they shopuld have a time where they are allowed to watch there series or there favorite movie,2,F,,,,,,,,
67,furthermore more many child series and movies on tv teach many life lessons so that the children will be prepared for life and their social life,2,R,,,,,,,,
68,for example dora or other series there are some episodes where they solve math problemes teach you how to deal with strangers or hoe to treat your friends,2,R,,,,,,,,
69,fact is that the series that they watch on tv prepare for school,2,F,,,,,,,,
70,the only thing that could be held against that statement is that there are not only children series on tv but also horror movies and other bad stuff that children at that age should not watch,2,R,,,,,,,,
72,also to hold against the argument that children that watch tv are not interfering with there family anymore the parents could watch the sereies with them and make a game out of it so they will make tv watching a family activity,2,R,,,,,,,,
80,the children would grow up with wrong information before they could understand the truth of the television and its consequences on their,2,F,,,,,,,,
81,there future lives could be mainly destroyed or would stay on the lies of the television,2,F,,,,,,,,
102,the information could be about important topics in our contemporary society for example about the responsable thing eith the nature,2,R,,,,,,,,
106,young children must play with other friends and should not sit at home to watch television,2,F,,,,,,,,
107,but often young children can learn something by watching television,2,R,,,,,,,,
109,also little children learn what is forbidden and what is right but they should watch series which are made for young children with an age of if they look criminal series it is not good for their evolution and they can missundertand what the people are doing,2,R,,,,,,,,
77,the first reason is that young children at the age  can not understand the main statement from the television because there brain can not translate or understand the film which is shown as a consequence it should not be allowed,3,R,3 -> reasons why we should not allow ads on tvs.,,,,,,,
78,my second reason is that this kids should not grow up with a television because if they look tv at the begin of their lives they could focus their future to look fluently and hours after hours tv and so they would  not focus on there future work lives,3,R,,,,,,,,
79,the third and important reason for me is that the television is a media which is lying fluently to have better quotes of the public to become famous and rich,3,R,,,,,,,,
82,my last reason is that children at the age of  are defintiv to young to look tv because of the risks and the consequences of this media to themselves,3,R,,,,,,,,
18,the children get irritated and dont know how to react,4,R,4 -> impacts of ads on children,,,,,,,
20,but children especially young children dont know,4,R,,,,,,,,
26,they create wrong needs and slow down the psychological development,4,R,,,,,,,,
32,they think that is cool and they often try to convince their parents,4,R,,,,,,,,
33,if they dont get the object they start to cry or they are sad about the desission of their parents,4,R,,,,,,,,
40,if they dont learn this they could have problems in their life,4,R,,,,,,,,
42,it stress the parents and it could destroy the entership between the family and friends,4,R,,,,,,,,
48,maybe because i am not a parent yet so its hard for me to find more arguments for and against the statement manchend at the begiining,4,F,,,,,,,,
66,that is what makes the children happy now a days,4,R,,,,,,,,
88,on the other hand if the parents take care of them and pay attention the children will not get any problems but they will have fun with their new toy or other things,4,F,,,,,,,,
108,an example is that they learn to treat the other children in the kindergarten better or learn to say different words,4,R,,,,,,,,
61,the children should be allowed to watch television and use all the technology the presnt has to offer because we are living in a constant development of technology and in the future there will be more of that,5,R, 5-> We live in the age of technology where everything is allowed,,,,,,,
63,the only thing parents could do is to set a limit of tv watching for there children so they can be social and hang out with there friends,5,F,,,,,,,,
73,in the end i can only say that television is a big part of our lifes now a days and that children in the age 25 must be allowed to interfier with that,5,R,,,,,,,,
74,in the future there will be more and more technology and we can not forbidm the children to not live that life,5,R,,,,,,,,
104,television  young people should  be allowed but the children should watch tv not so often like adults because they have not enough concentration to watch an hour a day,5,R,,,,,,,,
1,televison advertising could be helpful especialy for parents if they donâ´t have an idea concerning to give a present to their child,6,R,"6 -> we should allow watching tvs, pros of ads of tvs",,,,,,,
2,but on the other hand watching telivison advertising in these ages can lead to the missing ability to appreciate things which are advertised in the tv such as toys or electronic devises to play with,6,F,,,,,,,,
9,in the television is so much aadvertising like never before and even small children watch television,6,R,,,,,,,,
39,the children musst learn the trics of the televison advertisings because they should be responsible with the money,6,R,,,,,,,,
57,now a days a television and the outraging development of the technology is very normal to the young generation and there parent generation,6,R,,,,,,,,
84,this essay will be about the ban of advertising spots on television directing to children between the age of two and five,6,F,,,,,,,,
111,i disagree with this statement because it is not bad if little child seeing television advertising in this age but they should not watch it so often,6,R,,,,,,,,
17,on the other hand this adverts shouldnt be allowe because these young children cant do anything with this adverts,7,R,"7 -> Ads should not be allowed, reasons why we should ban tv ads.",,,,,,,
21,more important theses adverts influence the childrens mind and their psychological development,7,R,,,,,,,,
24,plus the strategy of advertisment is to create needs and children cant deal with that,7,R,,,,,,,,
38,in addition the parents should explain theire children how they have to handel with advertising,7,F,,,,,,,,
41,all in all the advertising isnt good for the young people,7,R,,,,,,,,
50,on one hand itâ´s not good to direct the advertising toward young children because the children in the age of  canâ´t say anything about there own opinion because they are to young to say it,7,R,,,,,,,,
51,i think children maybe donâ´t want advertising that is  them,7,R,,,,,,,,
52,the children aged  are far too young to think about there own opinion and to think about advertising being  them,7,R,,,,,,,,
53,on the other hand you could say that itâ´s good to direct the advertising toward young children even if they canâ´t say if they want to do that because itâ´s the only way to direct an advertising toward young children,7,F,,,,,,,,
85,on the one hand children are not able to think critically about the advertisement,7,R,,,,,,,,
93,to conclude i think these advertisements should not be allowed because for the children there is no benefit,7,R,,,,,,,,
98,furthermore young children believe what they hear or what they see so the advertisment could have negative effets on the children,7,R,,,,,,,,
103,in conlusion i would say that  a special advertisment for children should only be allowed if the advertisment is controlled by the parents or a kind of institute in the aspect of influece a learning,7,F,,,,,,,,
25,all in all adverts for children aged  shouldnt be allowed because of their negative effects on the children,8,R,8 -> the same as 7 ,,,,,,,
47,for me its hard to judge about this because i never thought so intensiv about this topic,9,R,9 -> neutral opinon not bad and not good,,,,,,,
76,in my opinion i agree with this statement because off some understandabel reasons and examples,9,F,,,,,,,,
110,televison advertising is not good for the childish brain because they do not know what is important and what is not but i do not think that it is bad if they watch it,10,R,10 -> neutral opinon not bad and not good,,,,,,,
22,thats not good,11,R,11 -> the only beneficary from the ads are the compaies,,,,,,,
27,they only help companies to improve their profits and this is not good,11,R,,,,,,,,
28,we shou,11,F,,,,,,,,
59,there are a few ones that do not have a probleme with the change but the most do,11,F,,,,,,,,
62,some say that it is all going to be compromized and going to be technical,11,F,,,,,,,,
83,yours jason,11,F,,,,,,,,
94,their health and happyness would suffer and the profit of the industry is not worth it,11,R,,,,,,,,
6,furthermore the parents have to have an eye on their children if they watch tv,12,R,12 -> role of the parents to protect the children,,,,,,,
37,he only tells the posi and the children see that and in result they get it from their parents,12,R,,,,,,,,
44,thats the way many people think about the influnce of media like televison on young childreni dont think it should be not allowed but i am not the opinion that its positive for them,12,R,,,,,,,,
45,every parent should decide if he lets his child watching things  which can be dangerous for the development of his own child,12,R,,,,,,,,
46,not everybody sees that as negativ because a lot of people doesnt believe that children for example aged  understand the things they seemany parents cant even imagine that many aspects while the growing process can have an influence on the futured personality of the kidsfor me its the biggest problem in todays community and forbiding of television andvertising directed to to the young children wouldnt be a solution for the probmlem,12,F,,,,,,,,
71,for that parents can just install a code for those channels so the children will not have a chance to watch these,12,R,,,,,,,,
92,but for the industry it is easier to persuade children than adults who reflect their actingthey would not profit of this ban although watching tv for young children is dangerous and unhealthy in general,12,F,,,,,,,,
105,moreover it is bad for the childrens eyes,12,F,,,,,,,,
58,the only generation is the elders generation whom are not used to technology at all,13,R,13 -> The elder generation is very bad in tech,,,,,,,
60,so the snetence above is mostly to hear form the older generation,13,R,,,,,,,,
112,younger people than,13,R,,,,,,,,
12,so the little child can watch tv and after the adverts it says that it likes to have this and that,14,R,14 -> companies can influence the kids to sell their products,,,,,,,
13,therefor the child doesnt have to speak well its enough to say i want that and it points on the advert,14,R,,,,,,,,
15,next this kind of advertising helps the companies to improve their sales and adress the specific group of people which the products are made for,14,R,,,,,,,,
16,so they would do babytoyadvertisments only for young children aged ,14,F,,,,,,,,
19,as an adolscent you know how to deal with adverts and that their content isnt always the truth,14,F,,,,,,,,
23,children may believe whats said in the advert,14,F,,,,,,,,
36,the seller push their object in the advertising because he know what he have to say,14,R,,,,,,,,
86,they cannot know wheather they really need a product or it is just unimportant,14,R,,,,,,,,
89,but children believe the promises of the advertising industry and if the parents buy the toy for them they will be really unhappy,14,R,,,,,,,,
97,the biggest argument against the advertisment is that children are very easy to influece because they do not have enough experience to know what is wrong and what is write,14,R,,,,,,,,
99,on the other hand children are learning very much in this part of life so the advertisment gives them the chance to make up their own mind about some products,14,R,,,,,,,,
100,but this aspect is just valuable if the advertisment is supposed for children and does not have strongly influecing parts,14,F,,,,,,,,
101,maby the companies could make an advertisment which gives the child useful information,14,R,,,,,,,,
